<p>Annotation summary:</p>
<p>--- Page 5 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>Ellis had found a leading indicator: just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”</p>
<p>After benchmarking nearly a hundred startups with his customer development survey, Ellis found that the magic number was 40%. Companies that struggled to find growth almost always had less than 40% of users respond “very disappointed, ” whereas companies with strong traction almost always exceeded that threshold.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>We identified users who recently experienced the core of our product, following Ellisʼ recommendation to focus on those who used the product at least twice in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>--- Page 6 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>We then emailed these users a link to a Typeform survey asking the following four questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you could no longer use Superhuman? A) Very disappointed B) Somewhat disappointed C) Not disappointed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of people do you think would most benefit from Superhuman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main benefit you receive from Superhuman?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we improve Superhuman for you?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>1) Segment to find your supporters and paint a picture of your high-expectation customers.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>If you instead use the "very disappointed" group of survey respondents as a lens to narrow the market, the data can speak for itself — and you may even uncover different markets where your product resonates very strongly.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>To start, we grouped the survey responses by their answer to the first question (“How would you feel if you could no longer use Superhuman?”):</p>
<p>We then assigned a persona to each person who filled out a survey.</p>
<p>--- Page 8 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>With this more segmented view of our data, the numbers shifted. By segmenting down to the very disappointed group that loved our product most, our product/market fit score jumped by 10%. We werenʼt quite at that coveted 40% yet, but we were a lot closer with minimal effort.</p>
<p>To go even deeper, I wanted to better understand these users who really loved our product.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>We took only users who would be very disappointed without our product and analyzed their responses to the second question in our survey: “What type of people do you think would most benefit from Superhuman?”</p>
<p>This is a very powerful question, as happy users will almost always describe themselves, not other people, using the words that matter most to them. This lets you know who the product is working for and the language that resonates with them (providing valuable kernels of insight for your marketing copy as well).</p>
<p>--- Page 10 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>These words of wisdom from Paul Graham explain why:</p>
<p>“When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.”</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>2) Analyze feedback to convert on-the-fence users into fanatics.</p>
<p>--- Page 11 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>To get to the root of how we were going to improve the product and expand the depth of its appeal, I found it helpful to focus my efforts on these key questions:</p>
<p>Why do people love the product?</p>
<p>What holds people back from loving the product?</p>
<p>To understand why users loved Superhuman, we once again turned to the segment of those who would be very disappointed without our product. This time, we looked at their answers to the third question on our survey: “What is the main benefit you receive from Superhuman?”</p>
<p>--- Page 12 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>After throwing the responses into a word cloud, some common themes emerged: the users who loved our product most appreciated Superhuman for its speed, focus and keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>Politely disregard those who would not be disappointed without your product. They are so far from loving you that they are essentially a lost cause.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>This batch of not disappointed users should not impact your product strategy in any way. Theyʼll request distracting features, present ill-fitting use cases and probably be very vocal, all before they churn out and leave you with a mangled, muddled roadmap. As surprising or painful as it may seem, donʼt act on their feedback — it will lead you astray on your quest for product/market fit.</p>
<p>--- Page 13 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>From analyzing our third survey question, we knew that happy Superhuman users enjoyed speed as their main benefit, so we used this as a filter for the somewhat disappointed group:</p>
<p>After splitting the somewhat disappointed group into two new segments around speed, hereʼs how we decided to act on their feedback:</p>
<p>Somewhat disappointed users for whom speed was not the main benefit: we opted to politely disregard them, as our main benefit did not resonate. Even if we built everything they wanted, they would be unlikely to fall in love with the product.</p>
<p>Somewhat disappointed users for whom speed was the main benefit: we paid very close attention to this group, because our main benefit did resonate. Something  —  probably something small —  held them back.</p>
<p>Focusing on this last group, we looked more closely at their answers to the fourth question on our survey: “How can we improve Superhuman for you?”</p>
<p>--- Page 14 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>3) Build your roadmap by doubling down on what users love and addressing what holds others back.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>If you only double down on what users love, your product/market fit score wonʼt increase. If you only address what holds users back, your competition will likely overtake you.</p>
<p>--- Page 16 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>To increase your product/market fit score, spend half your time doubling down on what users already love and the other half on addressing what's holding others back.</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>4) Repeat the process and make the product/market fit score the most important metric.</p>
<p>--- Page 17 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>Early adopters are more forgiving, and will enjoy your product's primary benefit despite its inevitable shortcomings. But as you push beyond this group, users become much more demanding, requiring feature parity with their current products. Your product/market fit score may well drop as a result.</p>
<p>However, this shouldnʼt cause too much anxiety, as there are some ways around it. If your business has strong network effects (think Uber or Airbnb), then the core benefit will keep getting better as you grow. If you're a SaaS company like Superhuman, you simply have to keep on improving the product as the pool of users expands. To do that, we rebuild our roadmap every quarter using this process, ensuring that weʼre improving our product/market fit score fast enough.</p>
<p>--- Page 18 ---</p>
<p>Highlight (yellow):</p>
<p>Taking a step back to reflect on what Iʼve learned from building this product/market fit engine for Superhuman, Iʼm left with two final takeaways:</p>
<p>Investors advising early-stage teams should avoid pushing for growth ahead of product/market fit. As an industry, we all know that this ends in disaster, yet the pressure for premature growth is still all too common. Startups need time and space to find their fit and launch the right way.</p>
