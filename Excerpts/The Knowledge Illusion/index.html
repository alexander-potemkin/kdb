<ul>
<li>The human mind is not like a desktop computer, designed to hold reams of information. The mind is a flexible problem solver that evolved to extract only the most useful information to guide decisions in new situations. As a consequence, individuals store very little detailed information about the world in their heads. In that sense, people are like bees and society a beehive: Our intelligence resides not in individual brains but in the collective mind. To function, individuals rely not only on knowledge stored within our skulls but also on knowledge stored elsewhere: in our bodies, in the environment, and especially in other people. When you put it all together, human thought is incredibly impressive. But it is a product of a community, not of any individual alone. (Location 89)</li>
<li>It’s remarkable how easy it is to disabuse people of their illusion; you merely have to ask them for an explanation. (Location 321)</li>
<li>Landauer next calculated how much information people have on hand—what the size of their knowledge base is—by assuming they learn at this same rate over the course of a seventy-year lifetime. Every technique he tried led to roughly the same answer: 1 gigabyte. He didn’t claim that this answer is precisely correct. But even if it’s off by a factor of 10, even if people store 10 times more or 10 less than 1 gigabyte, it remains a puny amount. It’s just a tiny fraction of what a modern laptop can retain. Human beings are not warehouses of knowledge. From one perspective, this is shocking. There is so much to know and, as functioning adults, we know a lot. (Location 381)</li>
<li>But this is only shocking if you believe the human mind works like a computer. The model of the mind as a machine designed to encode and retain memories breaks down when you consider the complexity of the world we interact with. It would be futile for memory to be designed to hold tons of information because there’s just too much out there. Cognitive scientists don’t take the computer metaphor so seriously anymore. There is a place for it; some models of how people think when they’re thinking slowly and carefully—when they are deliberating step-by-step as opposed to being intuitive and less careful—look like computer programs. (Location 388)</li>
<li>Donald Rumsfeld was the U.S. secretary of defense under both presidents Gerald Ford and George W. Bush. One of his claims to fame was to distinguish different kinds of not knowing: There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know we don’t know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we don’t know we don’t know. (Location 463)</li>
<li>Chaos theory is another mathematical tool that shows that the complexity of the world is too much to handle. In a chaotic system, tiny differences at the beginning of a process can lead to massive differences down the road. (Location 494)</li>
<li>The answer is that the brain was not designed by computer engineers. It was shaped by the forces of evolution to solve specific kinds of problems, and remembering tons of details doesn’t help achieve that. (Location 545)</li>
<li>Plants can be marvelously complex and fascinating (a plant called Paris japonica has a genome fifty times larger than that of humans), but they are not capable of sophisticated action. That’s why it’s so easy to cut down a tree or pick a flower; they can’t do anything about it. (Location 562)</li>
<li>remembering everything is in conflict with what the mind does best: abstraction. (Location 657)</li>
<li>As brains get more complex, they get better at responding to deeper, more abstract cues from the environment, and this makes them ever more adaptive to new situations. This is critical to understanding the knowledge illusion: Storing details is often unnecessary to act effectively; a broad picture is generally all we need. Sometimes storing details is counterproductive, as in the case of hyperthymesics and Funes the Memorious. (Location 671)</li>
<li>Perhaps the most common way that people pass causal information to one another is by storytelling. (Location 870)</li>
<li>People see stories everywhere. A good story goes beyond just describing what actually happened. It tells us about how the world works more broadly, in ways that pertain to things that didn’t actually happen or at least haven’t happened yet. (Location 886)</li>
<li>A good story has a moral that applies not just to this world but also to other worlds that we might find ourselves in. (Location 891)</li>
<li>Storytelling helps us to imagine how the world would be if something were different. (Location 895)</li>
<li>Thinking about alternative possible worlds is an important part of being human. It is called counterfactual thought, and you can see that it depends on our capacity to reason causally. (Location 900)</li>
<li>Many decisions are made by running little mental simulations to figure out the likely outcomes of different courses of action, based on our understanding of the causal laws governing the situation. (Location 914)</li>
<li>Stories are used to transmit causal information and lessons among people, as well as to share experiences, to organize a community’s collective memory, and to illustrate and announce an attitude. When a community agrees to buy into a particular story, they are accepting the attitude implied by the story. Americans who tell the story of the Sons of Liberty tossing chests of British tea overboard in Boston Harbor in 1773 are telling a story of proud defiance against coercion. When the British traders of the era whose tea was spoiled told the story, they were describing a bunch of thieving hooligans who needed to be taught a lesson. Thus stories generally belong to a community, not to an individual, and they are intimately tied to a community’s belief system. Stories may be communal entities, but telling them requires that individuals possess a cognitive system that’s up to the task. We have seen that the cognitive system’s ability to represent and reason about causal systems is limited, that we can’t as individuals deal with the actual complexity of the world. This is surely why stories tend to simplify and sometimes oversimplify events. (Location 922)</li>
<li>Nevertheless, stories are about the causal relations in the world, however much we simplify them. So individuals need a cognitive system that can understand the causality inherent in whatever the story they are telling is about. We need a cognitive system that can understand what protagonists and antagonists want to achieve, how obstacles prevent achievement of those goals, and how those obstacles are overcome (or not, as the case may be). These are all causal notions involving agents trying to cause the world to be a certain way. It is no coincidence that storytelling, the most natural mode of human discourse, depends on the very same resource—causal knowledge—that allows thinking to produce more effective action. (Location 932)</li>
<li>You don’t make money in Hollywood by being accurate. You make money by appealing to people’s intuitions. (Location 956)</li>
<li>Normal human thought is just not engineered to figure out some things. (Location 963)</li>
<li>Think about what it would take to make correct causal inferences in every situation. You would need to know everything about what the universe is like and you would need complete knowledge about how things change. Because the world is complex and because there are so many ways that things change, both kinds of knowledge are guaranteed to be far from perfect: incomplete, uncertain, and imprecise. In the real world, your knowledge is necessarily mostly about the part of the world that you’ve experienced. You also know more about things that are important to you than things you don’t care about. (Location 995)</li>
<li>So people know less than everything (surprise, surprise). In fact, we know a lot less. We know just enough to get by. Because our knowledge is limited, our understanding of how things change is correspondingly limited. Most of us don’t have to worry about the causal laws that apply to molecules and atoms because we’re not chemists or physicists. That’s why Newtonian physics is good enough to describe human experience even though it fails to be precisely correct both at microscopic levels (how atomic particles behave) and macroscopic levels (how the universe behaves at the largest scales). We just don’t experience the quantum effects physicists worry about that describe the world at levels outside our experience. (Location 1005)</li>
<li>Intuition gives us a simplified, coarse, and usually good enough analysis, and this gives us the illusion that we know a fair amount. But when we deliberate, we come to appreciate how complex things actually are, and this reveals to us how little we actually know. (Location 1133)</li>
<li>When I ask you how a toilet works, your intuitive system reports, “No problem, I’m very comfortable with toilets. They are part of my daily experience.” But when your deliberative system is probed by a request to explain how they work, it is at a loss because your intuitions are only superficial. The real knowledge lies elsewhere. (Location 1145)</li>
<li>(as long as it didn’t concern categories that remained the province (Location 1158)</li>
<li>Our dependence on smart technology has led to a paradox. As the technology improves, it becomes more reliable and more efficient. And because it’s reliable and efficient, human operators start to depend on it even more. Eventually they lose focus, become distracted, and check out, leaving the system to run on its own. In the most extreme case, piloting a massive airliner could become a passive occupation, like watching TV. This is fine until something unexpected happens. The unexpected reveals the value of human beings; what we bring to the table is the flexibility to handle new situations. (Location 1904)</li>
<li>The automation paradox is that the very effectiveness of automated safety systems leads to a dependence on them, and that this dependence undermines the contribution of the human operator, leading to greater danger. Modern technology is extremely sophisticated and getting more so. Automated safety systems are improving. As they get more complex and include additional bells and whistles and backup systems, they get exploited to do more and more. When they fail, the resulting catastrophe is that much bigger. The irony is that automated systems on airplanes, trains, and industrial equipment can compromise overall safety. Because the technology doesn’t understand what the system is trying to accomplish—because it doesn’t share the humans’ intentionality—there’s always the danger that something will go wrong. And when the human part of the system isn’t ready for the technology to fail, disaster can ensue. (Location 1909)</li>
<li>Most experts love the opportunity to demonstrate their expertise, especially when their contribution is acknowledged. Contributing to the community of knowledge is in our collaborative nature. (Location 1987)</li>
<li>But crowdsourcing works only when it provides access to expertise. Without expertise, it can be useless and even detrimental. (Location 1990)</li>
<li>The irony is that successful technology is always easy to use; it always seems familiar. So we will continue to feel a sense of understanding even though our understanding of these increasingly complex systems will be weaker and weaker. Our illusion of understanding will get stronger and stronger. (Location 2044)</li>
<li>Why do people have such passion about issues they know so little about? Here is Socrates’s answer in the guise of a response to a “political expert”: I reasoned to myself, as I left him, like this—“I am actually wiser than this person; likely enough neither of us knows anything of importance, but he thinks he knows something when he doesn’t, whereas just as I don’t know anything, so I don’t think I do, either. So I appear to be wiser, at least than him, in just this one small respect: that when I don’t know things, I don’t think that I do either.” (Plato, Apology, 21d; trans. Christopher Rowe) This guy, Socrates complained, just didn’t know what he didn’t know. Like so many of us, he knew less than he thought he did. In general, we don’t appreciate how little we know; the tiniest bit of knowledge makes us feel like experts. Once we feel like an expert, we start talking like an expert. And it turns out that the people we talk to don’t know much, either. So relative to them, we are experts. That enhances our feeling of expertise. (Location 2337)</li>
<li>Our tendency to mentally substitute individuals for complicated entities can be seen in how we talk about institutions. (Location 2650)</li>
<li>People are primarily designed for action, not for listening to lectures, not for manipulating symbols, and not for memorizing facts. (Location 2912)</li>
<li>The problem that students have—that we all have, actually—is that this sense of familiarity can be confused with actual understanding of the material. (Location 2931)</li>
<li>The idea that education should increase intellectual independence is a very narrow view of learning. It ignores the fact that knowledge depends on others. To fix cars, a mechanic needs to know who can provide parts and who can deliver them, how to find out which cars have been recalled, and how to learn about the latest design innovations. Cars these days depend on technology that comes from all around the world. A decent car mechanic will have access to knowledge distributed throughout the community of knowledge within the automobile industry. Learning therefore isn’t just about developing new knowledge and skills. It’s also about learning to collaborate with others, recognizing what knowledge we have to offer and what gaps we must rely on others to help us fill. Imagine you’re learning about the history of Spain. It’s not good enough to just learn about what happened within the borders of Spain. You also have to be aware of the Roman Empire, the Crusades, the history of the Moors, and so much more. Part of knowing the history of Spain is knowing about the context surrounding that history. You don’t need to know it in detail—you can’t, there’s just too much of it—but you need at least a skeletal understanding of Spain’s historical context. When you have that skeletal understanding, you’ll know what other information is available and who to get it from. You’ll be able to make use of the community of knowledge. A real education includes learning that you don’t know certain things (a lot of things). Instead of looking in at the knowledge you do have, you learn to look out at the knowledge you don’t have. To do this, you have to let go of some hubris; you have to accept that you don’t know what you don’t know. Learning what you don’t know is just a matter of looking at the frontiers of your knowledge and wondering what is out there beyond the border. It’s about asking why. Instead of learning to ask about events that occurred in Spain, it’s learning to ask about other countries and how they influenced events in Spain. Instead of just learning long division, it’s learning to ask what you don’t know, like why long division works. As individuals, we know little. There’s not too much we can do about that; there’s too much to know. Obviously we can learn some facts and theories, and we can develop skills. But we also have to learn how to make use of others’ knowledge and skills. In fact, that’s the key to success, because the vast majority of the knowledge and skills that we have access to reside in other people. In a community of knowledge, an individual is like a single piece in a jigsaw puzzle. Understanding where you fit requires understanding not only what you know but also what others know that you don’t. Learning your place in a community of knowledge requires becoming aware of the knowledge outside yourself, what you don’t know that touches on what you do know. (Location 2960)</li>
<li>Since 2006, a course entitled Ignorance has been taught at Columbia University. Guest scientists are invited to speak about what they don’t know. The scientists come from a variety of disciplines to discuss what “they would like to know, what they think is critical to know, how they might get to know it, what will happen if they do find this or that thing out, what might happen if they don’t.” The course focuses on all that is not in the textbooks and thus guides students to think about what is unknown and what could be known. The idea is to focus not on what students themselves don’t know, but what entire fields of science don’t know, with the aim of provoking and directing students to ask questions about the frontiers of a scientific field. This course requires that students ponder not just some set of scientific theories and associated data; it requires that they begin to understand what the entire community has and hasn’t mastered. A good way to learn about what one doesn’t know is to learn about a discipline by doing the work of the discipline. Scientists work at the frontiers of their fields. Their job is to change what is unknown into what is known. So learning to act like a scientist entails finding out what is unknown. Associations representing a variety of fields advocate this approach to science education. (Location 2982)</li>
<li>How is science actually done? It turns out that scientists don’t spend their time alone in their labs uncovering nature’s mysteries. Science is done by a community. There is a division of cognitive labor: Different scientists are experts in their own domain and scientific knowledge is distributed across the community of scientists. This division doesn’t just mean that each scientist has a little bit of knowledge and that the sum total of knowledge depends on everybody. The division of cognitive labor is a constant presence; the community infiltrates everything that a scientist does. Every technique the scientist employs, every theory a scientist appeals to, every idea a scientist has is made possible by the community. Imagine you’re a modern-day molecular biologist trying to figure out, say, how plants reproduce: how the DNA from a mommy and a daddy plant gets combined and replicated over and over to produce baby plants. You read about a new finding involving the role of a molecule called RNA in transferring information around the cell. Do you go out and replicate the finding before you believe it? Very rarely. If you did, you would spend all your time and resources replicating the work of others. Instead, you just believe it (while keeping in the back of your mind the possibility that what you read is wrong). Similarly, if you’re taught a new fancy method to analyze your data, you’re not likely to derive the method yourself, checking every proof and approximation. That would require more time than it would take to rewrite every book that was ever written. If your community tells you that a method is a good one, normally you’ll just run with it. Science is all about justification—coming to only those conclusions that can be justified. Justifications come in various forms. One way is through direct observation (using a microscope, we can actually see a father’s set of chromosomes pairing with a mother’s at conception). Another way is through inference (the original geneticist Gregor Mendel inferred the existence of chromosomes by observing how traits are passed from parents to offspring). But most conclusions in science aren’t based on either observation or inference. Instead, they are based on authority, on what is written down in a textbook or journal article or what your expert friend tells you. That’s one role of the community of knowledge, to supply facts when direct justification would take too much time or be too costly or difficult. The community of knowledge fills in the vast majority of the details in our knowledge. Everyone’s understanding—that of scientists and nonscientists alike—is dependent on what others know, so it is more important for students to understand what is known and what can be justified by others than to know the facts and the justifications themselves. A molecular biology lab will make progress only if those working in it are willing to use tools and methods that they don’t fully understand, but that are accepted by the larger community of molecular biologists. Because most knowledge is not maintained inside their own heads, scientists operate on trust, as we all do. We drive cars with little comprehension of the incredible technology that makes them go, and we turn on the light without fully understanding how switches work (modern switches are more sophisticated than you might think). Much of what scientists hold true is a matter of faith—not faith in a supreme being, but faith that others are telling the truth. What distinguishes this faith from religious faith is that there is a higher power to appeal to: namely, the power of verification. Scientific claims can be checked. If scientists are not telling the truth about a result or if they make a mistake, eventually they are likely to be found out because, if the issue is important enough, someone will try and fail to replicate their result. Scientists care about the truth, but what drives their day-to-day behavior isn’t the search for truth as much as the social life entailed by a community of knowledge. Jane Doe’s success as a researcher is only indirectly related to how many important findings she discovers in her laboratory. She’ll get tenure at Harvard and be allowed to stay there only if she publishes those findings in high-profile outlets. So her job is as much to persuade others of the importance of her work as it is to actually do the work. To get published, she has to write papers that convince peer reviewers and editors to print them in high-profile outlets. In this way, scientists are constantly evaluating the quality of one another’s contributions, and like it or not, evaluation is a social process. Scientists also must obtain funding and other resources to do their work, to pay students and assistants, and to travel to various venues to participate in community events such as conferences and workshops. Resources come from other people, people in government agencies, foundations, and other institutions. Some of the people making decisions about who gets resources are other scientists (other people include politicians and business interests). So these people also need to be persuaded that funding a scientist will benefit the larger community (or the donor’s private interest). This is another way in which a scientist depends on the community. So if you believe that science education should reflect science itself, then science education needs to train people to rely on the knowledge of others. This would help develop thoughtful individuals who are in tune with their environments. It’s also important for legal reasons. Individuals, even nonscientists, can be held responsible for negligence even though scientific knowledge was necessary to foresee the harm that was done. In our youth, one of us heard about a guy who sold a white powdered household cleaning product as cocaine. Despite our youth, we recognized that such an act was not only illegal but pure evil. We knew nothing of biochemistry, but we knew enough to know that any reasonable person would assume that snorting cleaning crystals would likely be fatal (or worse). Similarly, it is not obvious to the naif why disposing of engine oil down the drain is so bad for the environment, but it is. Pleading ignorance is not a defense. Understanding certain consequences of our actions takes a scientist, but we’re responsible for those consequences even if we’re not scientists. In that sense, our everyday actions depend on the knowledge of scientists to stay within the law. In every domain of life, knowledge is interdependent. The knowledge that I’m legally responsible for is not necessarily in my head. The interdependence of knowledge is truer today than it has ever been. Many scientific fields have become so interdisciplinary that the breadth of knowledge encompassed makes it impossible to master all the knowledge required to do scientific research. More than ever, scientists depend on one another to work. (Location 3001)</li>
<li>An important part of an education consists of learning whether a claim is plausible, who would know, and whether that person is likely to tell the truth. There’s no simple answer to making any of these judgments, but an educated person should be better at them than an uneducated one. This isn’t just true in science; it’s true of everything we teach, be it the law, history, geography, literature, philosophy, or anything else. (Location 3079)</li>
<li>It means that we should take Dewey’s advice to heart and instead of teaching to the “person-solo,” we should teach to human beings who rely on the world and others to learn, to figure things out interactively, and to retain information. (Location 3083)</li>
<li>Group thinking creates a richer intellectual environment that individual thinkers can steep themselves in. (Location 3104)</li>
<li>Being dependent on others for what we know makes us vulnerable to those who would exploit this fact in order to spread falsehoods. (Location 3134)</li>
<li>The marketplace is set up to take advantage of explanation foes’ abhorrence of detail. (Location 3218)</li>
<li>A lot of research has focused on trying to explain why consumers don’t find them more attractive. One of the reasons is that consumers don’t understand them. (Location 3264)</li>
<li>A lot of the kind of legalese one comes across reflects a lack of appreciation for the role of the community of knowledge in decision-making. Communications are written by experts. Those experts feel like everyone must understand what they write because the expert does. This is the curse of knowledge. It is a result of participation in the community of knowledge—the failure to separate what is in one’s own head from what is in the heads of others. On top of that, most people are not inclined to master the details. Most of us are explanation foes. Our lives are filled with situations where we are confronted with things we don’t really understand. Sometimes we don’t even realize there are gaps in our understanding. Even when we do, we are often too uninterested or embarrassed to ask for help. (Location 3285)</li>
<li>We have advisers we can turn to if we ever do need details, a marketplace where the best financial products should float to the top because others have done the research, and laws that are presumably written to protect people like us, (Location 3323)</li>
<li>Lesson 1: Reduce Complexity Because so much of our financial knowledge is possessed by the community and not by us individually, we need to radically scale back our expectations of how much complexity people can tolerate. We need to give people the opportunity to understand and evaluate products and then decide for themselves. They can do this only if they have the wherewithal to absorb the information in the decision-making environment. On Reddit you can find a discussion forum called “Explain Like I’m 5.” People post questions, often about difficult topics like particle physics or finance, and forum members try to provide a satisfying explanation that is easily understood. The popularity of this forum speaks to how enjoyable it is to read explanations that we can actually make sense of. It also highlights how rare these are in our day-to-day lives. (Location 3369)</li>
<li>Decision rules might be more effective if they are supplemented with a short, clear explanation that gives people an understanding of why the rule is a good one. Giving people a correct intuition about the benefit of diversifying, the power of compound interest, or other core financial principles might make them more likely to apply rules correctly and stick to them. (Location 3384)</li>
<li>Just-in-Time Education Here’s one more idea. John G. Lynch Jr., the director of the Center for Research on Consumer Financial Decision Making at the University of Colorado, advocates for an approach he calls “just-in-time” financial education. The idea is to give people the information they need just before they need it. (Location 3387)</li>
<li>real understanding requires knowing what you don’t know. Knowing what you don’t know allows you to get help and fill in the gaps when the need arises. It brings you down to earth and prevents you from allowing intellectual arrogance to drive important decisions, decisions that you might regret later. Knowing what you don’t know about your credit, new house, potential spouse, and little red sports car can be the trigger to cause you to obtain solid advice from someone who isn’t trying to profit from your bad decisions. (Location 3408)</li>
<li>This is the advice given by Ray Dalio, founder and cochief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund. “My success is . . . due to how I deal with not knowing . . . How I go look for where I might be wrong . . . I love to find people who could disagree with me . . . I can see it through their eyes and I can consider, is that right, is that wrong? That learning experience helps me learn more and it also helps me make better decisions. So it’s dealing with what one doesn’t know that’s more effective than knowing.” By knowing what he doesn’t know, Dalio has learned to take advantage of the community of knowledge. This has proven quite the successful strategy. Bridgewater is currently the largest hedge fund in the world. It’s a piece of advice that we can all use when making all kinds of decisions. (Location 3413)</li>
<li>This pairing explains what is commonly known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, that those who perform the worst overrate their own skills the most. The effect is found by giving a group of people a task to do and then asking them how well they think they’ve done on the task. Poor performers overestimate how well they’ve done; strong performers often underestimate their performance. The effect has been found many times both in the psychological laboratory and in many real-world environments: among students, in offices, and among doctors. And Dunning has collected an impressive amount of evidence that the reason it happens is that those who lack skills also lack the knowledge of what skills they’re missing. So they think they’re pretty good. Those who have skills have a better sense of what the terrain looks like: They know what skills they could improve on. The unskilled just don’t know what they don’t know. And, according to Dunning, it matters because all of us are unskilled in most domains of our lives: Our ignorance, in general, shapes our lives in ways we do not know about. Put simply, people tend to do what they know and fail to do that which they have no conception of. In that way, ignorance profoundly channels the course we take in life . . . People fail to reach their potential as professionals, lovers, parents, and people simply because they are not aware of the possible. This is a fact of life. We can’t choose what we don’t know about. Most of the time, this isn’t a problem. We won’t miss Disneyland if we don’t know it’s there. It’s only knowledge of enticing possibilities that makes us miss them. That’s why winning the lottery can be more of a burden than a pleasure: Once we’ve tasted getting what we want, we can’t go back to our state of ignorance. This is the best argument we’ve encountered both for staying away from addictive substances and—for those of us with limited budgets—from expensive consumer items. The less you know about them, the less you’ll miss them and the happier you’ll be. But ignorance has costs. If we don’t know about birth control, then we won’t use it. If we remain ignorant about the horrors that are going on next door, we won’t do what’s necessary to stop them. And if we are ignorant about the dangerous things our children are getting into, disaster can follow. (Location 3458)</li>
<li>A strong leader is one who knows how to inspire a community and take advantage of the knowledge within it, and who can delegate responsibility to those with the most expertise. (Location 3481)</li>
<li>Society has come as far as it has because most people are cooperative most of the time. We try to surround ourselves with people who report only what they know, and tell us if they’re not sure. And we mostly succeed. We can almost always trust the people we interact with; that’s what makes community living possible. (Location 3495)</li>
<li>By avoiding illusion, you’re more likely to be accurate. You’ll know what you know and what you don’t know, and this can only help you achieve your goals. You won’t take on projects that are beyond you and you will be less likely to disappoint others. You’ll be better positioned to deliver on your promises. But illusion is a pleasure. Many of us spend a significant part of our lives living in illusion quite intentionally. We entertain ourselves with fictional worlds that offer no pretense of being real. And we fantasize, for the pleasure of it and also to enhance our creativity. Illusions can stimulate creative products by inspiring us to imagine alternative worlds, goals, and outcomes. (Location 3502)</li>
<li>whatever is causing this illusion also has the potential to cause her to achieve great things. Thank heaven for little illusions. (Location 3555)</li>
