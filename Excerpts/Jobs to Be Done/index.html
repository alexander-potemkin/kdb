<ul>
<li>Innovation to the Core, Strategos CEO Peter Skarzynski and Rowan Gibson say that “successful innovation is a numbers game… the chance of finding a big, new opportunity is very much a function of how many ideas you generate, how many you pick out and test with low-cost experiments.” [Peter Skarzynski and Rowan Gibson, “Innovation to the Core” (Chicago: Strategos, 2008), 137.] (Location 504)</li>
<li>For example, the authors of the recently published Innovators Guide to Growth believe that “if you fail fast and fail cheap, you have actually done your company a great service.” [Scott D. Anthony, Mark W. Johnson, Joseph V. Sinfield, and Elizabeth J. Altman, The Innovator’s Guide to Growth, Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work, (Harvard Business Press, 2008), 94.] (Location 520)</li>
<li>the ideas-first approach to innovation cannot be counted on for predictable growth and is inherently doomed to failure. (Location 525)</li>
<li>Imagine the implications of knowing all your customer’s needs. (Location 631)</li>
<li>Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt said, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!" Clayton Christensen said, “People buy products and services to get a job done”. In his most recent book he says, “Customers don’t buy products; they pull them into their life to make progress.” (Location 636)</li>
<li>While defining the functional job correctly is important, uncovering the customer’s desired outcomes (the metrics they use to measure success when get the job done) is the real key to success at innovation. (Location 727)</li>
<li>Products have a lifecycle. After a product is purchased (which is a separate job), it must be received, installed and set-up. Then someone has to learn how to use it and interface with it. Someone may also have to transport, clean, store, maintain, upgrade, repair, and dispose of it. While people don’t buy a product so they can clean, repair and dispose of it, a product that simplifies product consumption along one or more of these dimensions could differentiate itself in the marketplace. Dyson, for example, created the bagless system for collecting and disposing of dirt in a vacuum cleaner, making consumption more convenient. Shirt makers, who have differentiated themselves through non-iron shirts, serve as another example. (Location 751)</li>
<li>The jobs along the product lifecycle are called consumption chain jobs. Each consumption chain job is comprised of its own distinct set of desired outcome statements. The purchase process itself can be considered a consumption chain job as customers must research, evaluate and transact the purchase. This “purchase job” is often worth analyzing to help improve the purchase process. We have completed extensive research with Harte Hanks doing exactly that, revealing significant opportunities for retailers to improve the way they sell their products to in-store consumers. Other consumption chain jobs are also a possible focal point for product improvement and competitive differentiation. (Location 756)</li>
<li>When buying a product or service, the purchase decision maker (buyer) uses a set of financial metrics to decide whether or not to buy product A or product B, or to buy from supplier A or supplier B. An understanding of the buyer’s financial needs informs the decisions that lead to product and business model innovation. It is not uncommon to find that buyers consider 40 to 80 financial outcomes (metrics) when making the purchase decision. A hospital administrator who is responsible for buying medical devices, for example, may be looking for products that “reduce the patient’s length of stay”, or “reduce morbidity rates”. These metrics have cost implications that drive the purchase decision. In the case where the buyer is also the user, it is important to make sure the buyer is wearing the buyer’s hat when describing the financial metrics used when making the purchase decision. Otherwise outcome statements regarding the core functional job may uncovered instead. (Location 765)</li>
<li>new products and services win in the marketplace if they help customers get a job done better (faster, more predictably, with higher output) and/or more cheaply. (Location 784)</li>
<li>Disruptive strategy. A company pursues a disruptive strategy when it discovers and targets a population of overserved customers or nonconsumers with a new product or service offering that enables them to get a job done more cheaply, but not as well as competing solutions. Examples of offerings that successfully employed a disruptive strategy include Google Docs (relative to Microsoft Office), TurboTax (relative to traditional tax services), Dollar Shave Club’s razor offering (relative to Gillette), eTrade’s online trading platform (relative to traditional financial brokerages) and Coursera’s online educational services (relative to traditional universities). (Location 824)</li>
<li>Discrete strategy. A company pursues a discrete strategy when it targets a population of “restricted” customers with a product that gets the job done worse, yet costs more. This strategy can work in situations where customers are legally, physically, emotionally, or otherwise restricted in how they can get a job done. Examples of offerings that successfully employ a discrete strategy include drinks sold in airports past security checkpoints, stadium concessions at sporting events, check-cashing and payday-lending services, and ATMs in remote locations. (Location 829)</li>
<li>a company must know whether or not there are underserved and/or overserved segments of customers in the target market. Without this knowledge, there is no way to know which strategy to adopt, and the chances of picking the wrong one are high. For example, in an overserved segment, a differentiated strategy would likely fail, as no customer is seeking a more expensive product or service that will get the job done better. Conversely, in an underserved segment, a disruptive strategy would likely fail, as no customer is seeking a cheaper product or service that would get the job done worse. (Location 842)</li>
<li>A differentiated strategy works when a highly underserved segment of customers is targeted with a premium-priced offering that gets the job done significantly better. This strategy results in a disproportionate share of profits and is the strategy pursued by many of the world’s fastest-growing and most profitable companies. Nest, for example, a recent entrant into the home thermostat market, beat Honeywell, White-Rodgers, and other well-established incumbent firms with a product that was targeted at a highly underserved segment of the market, superior in performance, and offered at seven times the price of competing solutions ($250 versus $35). (Location 852)</li>
<li>A differentiated strategy is attractive because it enables a company to enter a market at the high end, capture significant profit share, and work its way down market over time to gain additional market share. This is a way to move from employing a differentiated strategy with an initial product entry to employing a dominant strategy with other products over time. A company can successfully move down market by lowering the price of its older products as it introduces newer and better products into its portfolio, as Apple did with the series of iPhone product offerings, and/or by using operational innovation as a means to lower production costs, as Uber did when it employed freelance drivers to supply rides in its UberX offering. (Location 858)</li>
<li>Our experience suggests that companies can win with a dominant strategy if they introduce a product or service that gets the job done (addresses the customer’s unmet desired outcomes) at least 20% better and at least 20% more cheaply. This can be measured with high precision and probability when evaluating a proposed concept against a complete set of desired outcome statements. Netflix’s streaming services, for example, offered greater convenience than traditional rental stores such as Blockbuster by making it easier to find, obtain, and consume movies. In addition, they reduced the cost of watching a movie by eliminating the annoying late-return fees and enabling customers to watch more content for a low monthly subscription rate. (Location 867)</li>
<li>Clayton Christensen, who coined the term disruptive innovation, was correct: companies can win in overserved segments with products that enable customers to get a job done more cheaply, but not as well as competing solutions. Based on our model, we also agree with Christensen that a disruptive strategy successfully serves two customer segments: highly overserved customers (like users of Microsoft Word who switched to Google Docs) and nonconsumers—people who do not buy currently available products. A disruptive strategy works in both situations, but for different reasons. It works for current consumers who are overserved, as Christensen’s theory suggests, and are willing to make some sacrifices to get the job done more cheaply. Nonconsumers, on the other hand, are underserved: they simply can’t afford any of the solutions that are currently available. If a product comes along that they can afford, it will allow them to get the job done better than they can currently. Christensen also correctly identified another phenomenon that occurs in the marketplace when he described disruptive innovation as “a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market, eventually displacing established competitors.” Seen through the Job-to-be-Done lens, the “process of disruption” is best described as the introduction of a series of products, the first of which employs a disruptive strategy that gets the job done worse and more cheaply, followed by a series of products that build on that technology platform, with more and more features, until the newest offerings get the job done better and more cheaply (figure on next page). (Location 879)</li>
<li>with a discrete strategy, a company takes an existing product and sells it in a unique situation that justifies a higher price. A discrete strategy is best suited for situations in which a higher-priced version of the existing product would be very welcome—or where a captive clientele cannot object. Pursuing a discrete strategy can be very profitable. The key to a successful discrete strategy is the ability to identify situations in which the customer, in need of the company’s product, has restricted or no access to it. In such a situation, the company can justify charging a higher price for its purchase. For example, people who are unable to cash a check at a bank because they do not have a bank account have no choice but to pay high fees to cash their checks at an independent check-cashing center. Stubhub.com also capitalizes on this scarcity strategy by allowing tickets that are sold out to be re-sold/auctioned to people for what the market will pay, often at much higher-than-normal prices. As another example, consider airline travelers who are legally prohibited from taking bottles of drinking water through security. This restriction enables concessions at the gates to employ a discrete strategy, as they are now justified in charging significantly more for water (and many other food and beverage items) to travelers. Similarly, movie theaters, sporting arenas, and theme parks restrict what visitors can bring in and consequently are able to employ a similar strategy. Restrictions resulting from high demand can also justify higher prices. Airlines, for example, typically charge more for seats when supply is tight. It should be noted that although employing a discrete strategy may hold the potential for high profits, it can also be viewed as exploitative by customers and result in public backlash and/or reputational damage as it has with pharmaceutical giant Mylan over the high cost of EpiPens. (Location 898)</li>
<li>Employing a Sustaining Strategy A sustaining strategy is good for products or services that get the job done just slightly better and/or more cheaply. We define “slightly” as less than 5% better or cheaper. New market entrants should avoid a sustaining strategy, as they will not be offering anything enticing enough to lure customers away en masse from a favorite brand or product. The risk is too high to make a switch. Customers generally will only switch to a new product if it gets the job done upwards of 20% better—which is characteristic of a differentiated or dominant strategy. Here again, using desired outcome statements as the basis for evaluating whether or not a product will get the job done better (and how much better) is a critical step in bringing data-driven decision making to the innovation process. Sustaining innovation is a good strategy for an incumbent to follow to maintain market position, market share, and margins. In established markets, getting the job done slightly better and slightly more cheaply lets a company take share from a competitor. (Location 912)</li>
<li>(Location 947)</li>
<li>I. DEFINE THE CUSTOMER Before a company can understand the customer’s needs, company managers must agree on exactly who the customer is. Gaining such agreement is not easy. When we ask company managers who their customer is, we typically hear, “We have many customers.” Often they add that customers include both “internal stakeholders and external customers.” To further complicate matters, external customers are typically said to include influencers, decision makers, buying groups, end users, operators, installers, and others. In a medical device company, for example, external customers include the surgeon, patient, insurer, nurse, operating-room manager, and hospital buying group, among others. (Location 950)</li>
<li>Let’s start with the why question. Why do we need to know who the customer is? Obviously, we want to know whom it is we’re trying to serve, but there is a more tactical reason. From a strategy and innovation perspective, we must identify the customer so we can gain the insights we need to create products and services that will get the job done better and/or more cheaply. So the question becomes, “Who holds these insights?” Through our work, we have discovered that there are three key customers types (or job executors) that must be considered: the end user (or functional job executor), the product life cycle support team, and the purchase decision maker. (Location 956)</li>
<li>The end user is the person who uses the product or service to get the core functional job done. In many situations, the end user and the purchase decision maker are different people. The end user can provide your company with the functional metrics (desired outcomes) it needs to figure out how to create a product that will get the job done faster, more predictably, and more efficiently, with higher output or throughput. For a medical device manufacturer, the end user of a surgical tool is the surgeon. The surgeon may be seeking products or services that will “minimize the likelihood of removing healthy tissue” or “quickly determine the points of affixation for attachment.” End users are also able to provide your company with a list of their emotional jobs and their related jobs, two other key inputs identified in the Jobs-to-be-Done Needs Framework (Location 962)</li>
<li>THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE SUPPORT TEAM The product lifecycle support team is comprised of the people who install, set up, store, transport, maintain, repair, clean, upgrade, and dispose of the product. In certain situations, the end user may also be part of product life cycle support team. Not all these consumption chain jobs apply in every situation, but the people responsible for the ones that do apply can provide your company with the desired outcome statements that will lead to a product that requires less support. A product that does not have to be installed, set up, stored, transported, and so on, is far more valuable than one that does. Simplifying or eliminating these consumption chain jobs has two key benefits: (i) it can lower the cost of product ownership, which satisfies the needs of the purchase decision maker, and (ii) it makes the product more convenient to use, which satisfies the needs of the end user. All those responsible for supporting the product throughout its lifecycle are key customers because their insights make it possible for the company to create a more positive customer experience. THE PURCHASE DECISION MAKER The purchase decision maker is responsible for seeking out and evaluating alternative offerings and deciding which to buy. The purchase decision maker can provide your company with the financial desired outcomes it needs to figure out how to create a product or service that will get the job done more cheaply. The buyer of a surgical tool (who could be an operating-room manager, a hospital administrator, or someone holding another title), for example, may be seeking products that will “reduce the patient’s length of stay” or “reduce the likelihood of a recurrence.” Financial metrics such as these drive the buying decision.   By focusing on these three customers, a company will gain the insights it needs to create a product or service that will get a job done better along multiple dimensions—and more cheaply. More importantly, if your company creates a product or service that addresses the unmet needs of all three of these customers, it will find that influencers will recommend it, distributors and retailers will carry it, those on social media will promote it, people will buy it, and your internal stakeholders will be satisfied by the financial rewards. (Location 968)</li>
<li>The core functional job is the stable, long-term focal point around which all other needs are defined and around which value creation should be centered. (Location 987)</li>
<li>To avoid defining the job to narrowly, work directly with customers to understand not why they bought your product, but how your product fits into what they are trying to accomplish. Ask, “Why are you using that product, what job are you ultimately trying to get done”. (Location 993)</li>
<li>think about the company, its products and its capabilities and ask, “Can and will the company address this job from beginning to end over time?” If the company does not have or is not willing to acquire the capabilities, resources, funding, and technology and know how to tackle the broader job then the job is defined too broadly from a practical standpoint. (Location 1002)</li>
<li>Take the customer’s perspective: When defining the core functional job, think about the job from the customer’s perspective, not the company’s. For example, a company that supplies herbicides to farmers may conclude that growers are trying to “kill weeds,” while the growers might say the Job-to-be-Done is to “prevent weeds from impacting crop yields.” (Location 1004)</li>
<li>Leave emotion and other needs out of it: When defining the core functional job make sure it is defined as a functional job, not as a hybrid functional/emotional/social job. A functional job does not have social and emotional dimensions. The emotional and social jobs related to the core functional job are defined in a series of separate emotional job statements. Also do not include desired outcomes in the functional job statement. They too must be stated separately. So if the job is to “cut a piece of wood in a straight line”, don’t say “accurately, safely and quickly cut a piece of wood in a straight line”. Accurately, safely and quickly vaguely describe outcomes associated with getting the job done. (Location 1012)</li>
<li>Define the job, not the situation: Do not define the Job-to-be-Done as a situation that a customer finds himself or herself in. Rather define the job around what the customer decides to do in that situation. (Location 1019)</li>
<li>Define the job statement in the correct format: A job statement always begins with a verb and is followed by the object of the verb (a noun). The statement should also include a contextual clarifier. In the job statement “listen to music while on the go”, the contextual clarification is made by adding “while on the go” to the job statement. (Location 1029)</li>
<li>Job statement = verb + object of the verb (noun) + contextual clarifier (Location 1033)</li>
<li>UNCOVER CUSTOMER DESIRED OUTCOMES With the core functional job defined, the next step in the ODI process is to create a “job map” for that job. A job map is a visual depiction of the core functional job, deconstructed into its discrete process or job steps, which explains in detail exactly what the customer is trying to get done. A job map does not show what the customer is doing (a solution view); rather, it describes what the customer is trying to get done (a needs view). A job map is focused on the underlying goals of the actions being taken. For example, you wouldn’t say an anesthesiologist is “looking at the display” (a solution that describes what action the anesthesiologist is taking). Instead, you would say the anesthesiologist is “monitoring the patient’s vital signs”, which is the underlying goal of looking at the display. In addition, a job map is not a customer journey or customer experience map: it does not describe the journey the customer goes through to buy, receive, set-up, use, upgrade, clean and maintain a product. These activities are consumption chain jobs that are captured and treated separately. If you are focusing on the customer journey, you are not focused on the core functional job. A good job map will describe what the customer is trying to get done independent of all the competing solutions that customers are using. In other words, it will be accurate for all customer situations, regardless of the products they are using to get the job done. A completed job map represents the “ideal process flow” for that job: all the steps in the ideal order for efficient execution. We create the job map for a number of reasons: The completed job map lays out the long term strategy for the organization—which is to devise a solution that gets the entire job done on a single platform or with a single offering (which may include hardware, software and services). It is often the case that innovative ideas can come from analyzing the job map, as it points out holes and inefficiencies in existing offerings. From a tactical standpoint, the job map serves as a framework and a guide for capturing the customer’s desired outcomes. For this reason, it is best to create the job map before attempting to capture desired outcome statements. (Location 1034)</li>
<li>all jobs consist of some or all of the eight fundamental process steps: define, locate, prepare, confirm, execute, monitor, modify and conclude (see the universal job map). (Location 1053)</li>
<li>(To learn more about job mapping, see “The Customer-Centered Innovation Map” in the May 2008 issue of the Harvard Business Review.) Once a job map is created for a specific functional job, desired outcomes are captured for each step in the job map. For any given Job-to-be-Done, we often uncover between 50 and 150 desired outcome statements. Customers know perfectly well how they measure success when executing a job and are very capable of communicating those metrics—and those metrics, simply put, are their desired outcomes. A corn farmer, for example, may want to “minimize the time it takes for the corn seeds to germinate” or to “minimize the likelihood that the plants fail to emerge at the same time.” (Location 1055)</li>
<li>A desired outcome statement includes a direction of improvement, a performance metric (usually time or likelihood), an object of control (the desired outcome), and a contextual clarifier (describing the context in which the outcome is desired). “Minimize the likelihood that the music sounds distorted when played at high volume” is one example of an outcome statement related to the job of listening to music.   When creating a desired outcome statement, remember the following structure: Outcome statement = direction of improvement + performance metric + object of control + contextual clarifier (See “Giving Customers a Fair Hearing,” in the Spring 2008 issue of the Sloan Management Reviewfor additional details on what a need is and the rules to follow when documenting outcome statements.) Desired outcome statements can be uncovered using any of the popular interviewing methods, such as personal interviews, focus groups, or observational or ethnographic interviews. While most qualitative research has a short shelf life, a complete set of desired outcome statements is an important company asset for years to come as desired outcomes don’t change over time—the solutions that address them do. With a complete set of desired outcome statements in hand, a company can gain quantitative insights into its market that were never before possible. (Location 1066)</li>
<li>demographic, psychographic, and behavioral and attitudinal data will nearly always fail to explain why customers have different unmet needs. A 28-year-old man from Montana with a college degree can have the same unmet needs as a 55-year-old woman from Florida who dropped out of high school. Both, for example, may be unhappy with their Internet service. The only way to discover segments of customers with unique sets of unmet needs is to segment the market around unmet needs. (Location 1085)</li>
<li>Outcome-Based Segmentation methodology is executed in four steps: First we analyze the Job-to-be-Done and capture all the customers’ needs in the form of desired outcome statements. (The special syntax of these outcome statements guarantees precision and comparability). Next, we field a survey that is administered to a statistically valid representative sample of customers (usually between 180 and 3,000 customers). Their answers reveal how important it is that they achieve each outcome and how well the solution they use today satisfies each outcome. With this data we determine which outcomes are most under-and overserved. Under-and overserved outcomes represent innovation opportunities. Third, we use factor analysis and cluster analysis to segment the market into groups of customers with unique sets of unmet desired outcomes. Lastly, we use profiling questions we include in the survey to understand what factors cause complexity and make some customers struggle more than others to get the job done. The survey also collects information that reveals the degree to which the different segments we uncovered are underserved. (Location 1102)</li>
<li>Knowing if and why segments of customers have different unmet needs is the key to an effective market and product strategy. A new product will fail if it doesn’t address unmet needs in a segment of the market that is large enough to warrant the investment. A value proposition will fail to connect with customers if it does not align with unmet customer needs. (Location 1113)</li>
<li>When we conduct segmentation analysis, we find segments of customers that are underserved (they have unmet needs), overserved (they’re getting extraneous features, perks, or services they don’t value), and appropriately served (all their needs are satisfied without any extraneous features). One market may be composed of three underserved segments, while another market may comprise three overserved segments. A disruptive strategy in the former case would fail, as no segment of the market is overserved. A differentiated strategy in the latter case would fail as no segment of the market is underserved. Because no market is homogeneous, outcome-based market segmentation is an essential ingredient in the formulation of market and product strategy. The key is to discover meaningful segments—hidden segments that offer the opportunity for value creation. (Location 1116)</li>
<li>product team. More specifically, we focused on wound care nurses (Location 1123)</li>
<li>To secure a winning value proposition, a company must (1) know where in the job the customer is underserved, (2) secure the value proposition that communicates to customers that their needs can be satisfied, and (3) do everything in its power to satisfy the targeted unmet needs better than its competitors. (Location 1142)</li>
<li>Once the value proposition is defined, the company must fulfill its promise. First, it must point out to customers ways in which its product or service already addresses the unmet needs it has discovered. Next, it must accelerate development of product and service features in the pipeline that further address the targeted unmet needs. Then it must create or invent new features that address any remaining unmet needs that are within the sphere of its value proposition. (Location 1148)</li>
<li>Why do you conduct competitive analysis? Is it merely to see which features of competitors’ products are technically superior? Or is the goal to gain the insight that is needed to create products and services that get a job done better and/or more cheaply than competing solutions? We argue that the latter should be the goal. Therefore, comparing feature sets—“speeds and feeds”—of competing products is a waste of time. It’s an outdated approach that provides irrelevant information. We conduct competitive analysis by having customers quantitatively evaluate competing offerings against a complete set of desired outcome statements. That process reveals precisely which offerings get the job done better and which get it done worse. These customer insights help along two fronts: (1) they pinpoint precisely which desired outcomes to address to offset the strengths of competing offerings, and (2) they reveal what underserved desired outcomes exist in the market as a whole, thus offering a path for leapfrogging all competitors and establishing a unique and valued competitive position. (Location 1154)</li>
<li>Another option was to introduce new laser-based technology to the market. While this sounded exciting, that technology would have had little impact on getting the job done better and would have added to the cost, a sure recipe for failure. (Location 1244)</li>
<li>THE OPPORTUNITY ALGORITHM The mathematical formula we use is as follows: Opportunity score = outcome importance + (outcome importance – outcome satisfaction) (Location 1261)</li>
<li>THE OPPORTUNITY LANDSCAPE The opportunity landscape shows visually which outcomes are under-and overserved. As shown in the figure, there are three main sections: (1) the underserved section (on the right), which includes all outcomes with an opportunity score of 10 or greater, (2) the appropriately served section (in the middle), and (3) the overserved section (on the left), in which outcomes’ satisfaction exceeds their importance. All the outcomes included in the quantitative survey are plotted on this landscape, revealing with a high degree of precision where the targeted segment is under-and overserved. This approach clearly points out which outcomes to target for growth. The upper right section of the landscape points out the “table stakes,” which are important outcomes that existing products satisfy and that new products must also satisfy to win in the marketplace. The overserved outcomes in the left-most area become targets for cost reduction. If existing products include costly features that address these overserved outcomes, replacing them with lower-cost features can help customers get the job done more cheaply. The outcomes in the lower part of the shaded area on the right are the most underserved. Addressing those outcomes will enable the customer to get the job done better. (Location 1268)</li>
<li>Borrow features from other company offerings Why reinvent the wheel? Innovation does not necessarily require invention. Innovation is the ability to use technology (existing or new) to address an unmet customer need. Knowing exactly what outcomes are underserved in a target segment, a company can analyze its product portfolio to see if any of its current products or services possesses a feature that addresses one or more of those outcomes. This can save significant development time and effort. (Location 1341)</li>
<li>Companies do not lack ideas. They often have thousands of ideas. What they need is insight into the customer’s underserved outcomes. (Location 1379)</li>
<li>A company’s ultimate goal should be to provide an offering that gets the entire job done on a single platform. Such a platform often requires hardware, software, and service subsystems or components. (Location 1391)</li>
<li>Wascha notes, “The most amazing thing is that we really did not write that many new lines of code to meet customer needs. Rather, it was about looking at the job in its flowchart, looking at software assets that we already had, and then piecing them together as solutions to each part of the job. (Location 1437)</li>
