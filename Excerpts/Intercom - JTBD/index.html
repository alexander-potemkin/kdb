<p>The four forces</p>
<p>The ReWired Group have identified four forces pushing and pulling customers away from making a purchase. In our mattress scenario, the forces are:</p>
<p>· The push of what is happening currently: “This mattress is pretty uncomfortable. I'm waking up multiple times in the night with back pain.” · The pull of a new solution: “If I get a new mattress, I can sleep better. I'll be in a better mood at home and at work.” · The anxiety of what could happen: “What if the new mattress turns out to be just as bad as the old one? I can only try it out for a few moments in the store.” · The attachment to what you currently have: “I've had this mattress since college.”</p>
<p>Our reasons for buying software can lean more toward business goals like increasing engagement or revenue, rather than personal goals like increasing overall happiness (though if software is well-designed, it can do both). You could argue for software, the purchase decision can be influenced by multiple previous purchases rather than just the push factors of the current tool. In a software scenario, the forces are:</p>
<p>· The push of what is happening currently: “We're not converting users at a rate that we'd like. We can't afford to keep paying so much per month for this tool.” · The pull of a new solution: “If we switch to a new tool that has more features around conversion, we can start hitting our targets.” · The anxiety of what could happen: “What if the new tool doesn't integrate as well as we'd like? We've tried three other tools for this job and none have been good enough.” · The attachment to what you currently have: “We've got workflows and integrations set-up and it'd be a pain to get them set up again.”</p>
