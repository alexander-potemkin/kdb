<li>The décor was standard-issue Silicon Valley tech: industrial shag (Location 65)</li>
<li>Wall Street is even simpler than religion. Your entire worth as a human is defined by one number: the compensation number your boss tells you at the end of the year. Pay on Wall Street works as follows: your base salary is actually quite modest, but your “bonus” is where the real money is. That bonus is completely discretionary, and can vary anywhere from zero to a multiple of your base salary. (Location 386)</li>
<li>In all my experience in both startups and large companies, including and especially at Facebook, I would always prefer—a hundred times prefer—being subject to the rigors of the market, the fickleness of luck, and the whims of users than to navigate the popularity-contest politics of a large company, surrounded by the mediocre duffers who’ve succeeded in life through nothing more than guile and appearances. (Location 436)</li>
<li>Every new form of media initially emulates the forms of the past. The first radio shows were merely people reading books on air, or playing instruments, with no use of clever sound effects or editing. The first TV shows were quiz shows that had originally appeared on radio, with mere headshots of the contestants. No sophisticated panning shots or jump cuts; simply the addition of a face to the spoken word. Internet advertising has the same atavistic resemblance to the newspaper advertising that preceded it. The first such ads were run in La Presse, a Parisian paper, in 1836. Advertisement was originally a scheme to lower the paper’s selling price and capture market share. A successful strategy, it was soon copied by all newspapers. The ads themselves were rectangular frames of advertiser-created content, placed either below or alongside regular content, and marked as distinct by their blocky frame and large, garish lettering. Sound like an ad you saw on nytimes.com recently? Of course, advertising isn’t the only place where this happens. We refer to spacecraft as “ships” given their resemblance to the seafaring kind, and given the intellectual origins of space travel in the mathematics and engineering of marine navigation. This emulation is merely a result of the organic progression of our mad and clever species from one technological toy to another. In the same way, marketers refer to websites and mobile apps as “publishers,” a quaint reflection of the advertising world’s origins in that of ink and newsprint. The “publisher” is simply the entity that brings the eyeballs to the auction block, whether via Pulitzer Prize–winning writing or a game in which you launch irate birds against antagonistic pigs. During the early days of Internet advertising, the publisher played a critical and powerful role. (Location 504)</li>
<li>Note that the goal is the same in both: to make you buy shit you likely don’t need with money you likely don’t have. (Location 552)</li>
<li>What is writing? It’s me, the author, taking the state inside my mind and, via the gift of language, grafting it onto yours. But man invented language in order to better deceive, not inform. That state I’m transmitting is often a false one, but you judge it not by the depth of its emotion in my mind, but by the beauty and pungency of the thought in yours. Thus the best deceivers are called articulate, as they make listeners and readers fall in love with the thoughts projected into their heads. It’s the essential step in getting men to write you large checks, women to take off their clothes, and the crowd to read and repeat what you’ve thought. All with mere words: memes of meaning strung together according to grammar and good taste. Astonishing when you think about it. (Location 653)</li>
<li>When confronted with any startup idea, ask yourself one simple question: How many miracles have to happen for this to succeed? If the answer is zero, you’re not looking at a startup, you’re just dealing with a regular business like a laundry or a trucking business. All you need is capital and minimal execution, and assuming a two-way market, you’ll make some profit. To be a startup, miracles need to happen. But a precise number of miracles. Most successful startups depend on one miracle only. For Airbnb, it was getting people to let strangers into their spare bedrooms and weekend cottages. This was a user-behavior miracle. For Google, it was creating an exponentially better search service than anything that had existed to date. This was a technical miracle. For Uber or Instacart, it was getting people to book and pay for real-world services via websites or phones. This was a consumer-workflow miracle. For Slack, it was getting people to work like they formerly chatted with their girlfriends. This is a business-workflow miracle. For the makers of most consumer apps (e.g., Instagram), the miracle was quite simple: getting users to use your app, and then to realize the financial value of your particular twist on a human brain interacting with keyboard or touchscreen. That was Facebook’s miracle, getting every college student in America to use its platform during its early years. While there was much technical know-how required in scaling it—and had they fucked that up it would have killed them—that’s not why it succeeded. The uniqueness and complete fickleness of such a miracle are what make investing in consumer-facing apps such a lottery. It really is a user-growth roulette wheel with razor-thin odds. The classic sign of a shitty startup idea is that it requires at least two (or more!) miracles to succeed. This was what was wrong with ours. We had a Bible’s worth of miracles to perform: (Location 680)</li>
<li>That was five miracles, just for starters (not to even mention practical ones like raising money and getting along with cofounders). It was four miracles too far. (Location 700)</li>

<li>The reality is, Silicon Valley capitalism is very simple: Investors are people with more money than time. Employees are people with more time than money. Entrepreneurs are simply the seductive go-betweens. Startups are business experiments performed with other people’s money. Marketing is like sex: only losers pay for it. Company culture is what goes without saying. There are no real rules, only laws. Success forgives all sins. People who leak to you, leak about you. Meritocracy is the propaganda we use to bless the charade. Greed and vanity are the twin engines of bourgeois society. Most managers are incompetent and maintain their jobs via inertia and politics. Lawsuits are merely expensive feints in a well-scripted conflict narrative between corporate entities. Capitalism is an amoral farce in which every player—investor, employee, entrepreneur, consumer—is complicit. But hey, look at these shiny iPhones. Right? (Location 1024)</li>

<li>symbolically, technology entrepreneurs are society’s chaos monkeys, pulling the plug on everything from taxi medallions (Uber) to traditional hotels (Airbnb) to dating (Tinder). One industry after another is simply knocked out via venture-backed entrepreneurial daring and hastily shipped software. Silicon Valley is the zoo where the chaos monkeys are kept, and their numbers only grow in time. With the explosion of venture capital, there is no shortage of bananas to feed them. The question for society is whether it can survive these entrepreneurial chaos monkeys intact, and at what human cost. (Location 1401)</li>
<li>Startups are business experiments performed with other people’s money. Here’s how you fund the experiment: The first money in is known as the seed round, as if germinating a mighty redwood tree. Historically, this money came from the proverbial friends and family, or from angels like Russ, or from the pseudoangels (as we’ll soon see) like Chris Sacca. Companies from measly AdGrok to mighty General Motors are funded via a mix of debt and equity. In the startup world the first money in is usually in debt form, which is counterintuitive, and also deceptive, as it’s not really debt that is paid off. All early-stage companies, except those that raise an exceptionally large round of funding from the get-go, raise on what’s called a convertible note. Despite the fancy name, it’s essentially debt with a nominal interest rate. Should the company be acquired or raise yet more money, this note converts into equity in the company, such that you became an actual owner rather than a creditor. Sounds more complicated than it is. What it boils down to is this: I “lend” you $100,000 to start a company. When you raise your next round of cash, I expect to get $100,000 in equity, at whatever the going price of equity is at that point. Here’s a simple example, with numbers chosen for ease of exposition, not business reality. An investor writes you a check for $100,000 to get the startup going. A year later, after hitting some product or usage milestones, you raise $1 million on a $10 million valuation (your typical postseed funding round, referred to as a “series A”). That debt—the original $100,000—converts into equity in the company. Given that the valuation is $10 million, and the investor put in $100,000, he now owns 1 percent of the company. From the point of the view of the investor, this is actually problematic. Say you’re the hot startup of the moment in the midst of a bubble, and you raise on some crazy valuation, such as $100 million. Well, pity our poor angel investor; he gets only 0.1 percent of the company. In essence, the better the company does, the less of it he gets. While he’s guaranteed (in theory) to get a price per share equal to follow-on investors, that’s actually a gross mispricing of his risk, as he put his money in far earlier, when the company was far riskier. Enter the investor’s great friend: the cap. The cap dictates the maximum number at which the company will be valued, for the purposes of calculating the investor’s stake when the company takes more investment capital. In our previous example, say the initial $100,000 investment had been done at a cap of $3 million. Then, despite the company’s raising later at a valuation of $10 million, the angel’s stake amounts to $100,000 ÷ $3 million = 3.3%, a much bigger slice. The angel’s effective price per share is that of the cap (rather than that of the valuation), giving him a huge discount on the equity compared with investors who just put money in. As a result, this cap is perceived in essence, if not in contractual reality, to be a proxy for the valuation of the company at the time of the angel’s investment. Early-stage entrepreneurs will bandy about their cap number as if it were a real company valuation, when in truth it’s an input to a hypothetical calculation that may or may not play out in the future. Funding a company via equity, rather than debt, is a different beast. With a capped note, there’s no universal agreed-upon value. You can bounce from investor to investor, like a bee from flower to flower gathering pollen, getting notes signed at various caps, and no one need be the wiser. In priced-equity rounds, however, everyone has to agree on a share price and a total amount sold, and everyone must sign on the dotted line at once. Typically there’s a round lead, usually the biggest investor in that round, who will help you herd the other investor cats into the deal. Also, the contractual legal work is more complex, and hence more expensive. Then the bank wires fly and you’re money. To make an analogy, a capped note is like having to seduce five women one after the other, while an equity round is having to convince five women to do a fivesome with you. The latter is exponentially harder than the former.<em> Why all this obsession with either a cap or a real valuation? Does it matter more than mere phallic jockeying for a big number? Yes, because the great enemy of every entrepreneur, the villain hiding in each cap table, is that monster of gradual, withering decay: dilution (!).</em> This refers to the obvious numerical fact that a company is in some ways a big, creamy cheesecake. You and your cofounders might own 90 percent of it to begin with (with 10 percent left for the eventual employee-option pool), but the more money you take in, the smaller the founders’ segment becomes. The higher the valuations (or the caps), the less the investors’ take, even for the same amount of money they give you. And so with each successive round of funding, the smaller your piece of cheesecake gets, no matter how the investors take their share, via debt or equity—and that’s why entrepreneurs struggle to keep that cap (or valuation) as high as possible. It’s effectively setting the price of that cheesecake wedge they’re selling, as well as its size. The higher the price, the less cheesecake they have to sell for the same amount of funding cash in the bank. (Location 1530)</li>
<li>In the summer of 2010, for the prechosen YC elite, a good cap was in the $6 million range. A stellar cap was around $8 million, and only a really buzzy company like Hipmunk, a travel startup that was a Reddit founder’s second act, got close to that. The middle of the YC pack (where we were) was in the $3 million to $4 million range. By the time this dinner-table conversation took place, Demo Day had come and gone, and we were talking to several investors. I had felt them out and realized we were safely in $3 million cap territory, and perhaps more. (Location 1572)</li>
<li>There are various flowery titles that the VC set adorn themselves with: “associate,” “principal,” “analyst,” “partner,” “operating partner,” “managing partner,” “general partner,” and so forth.

<li>Here is a key insight for any startup: You may think yourself a puny midget among giants when you stride out into a marketplace, and suddenly confront such a giant via litigation or direct competition. But the reality is that larger companies often have much more to fear from you than you from them. For starters, their will to fight is less than yours. Their employees are mercenaries who don’t deeply care, and suffer from the diffuse responsibility and weak emotional investment of a larger organization. What’s an existential struggle to you is merely one more set of tasks to a tuned-out engineer bored of his own product, or another legal hassle to an already overworked legal counsel thinking more about her next stock-vesting date than your suit. Also, large companies have valuable public brands they must delicately preserve, and which can be assailed by even small companies such as yours, particularly in a tight-knit, appearances-conscious ecosystem like that of Silicon Valley. America still loves an underdog, and you’ll be surprised at how many allies come out of the woodwork when some obnoxious incumbent is challenged by a scrappy startup with a convincing story. So long as you maintain unit cohesion and a shared sense of purpose, and have the basic rudiments of living, you will outlast, outfight, and out-rage any company that sets out to destroy you. Men with nothing to lose will stop at nothing to win. (Location 1855)</li>

<li>There are worse ways of monetizing sociopathy than startups. If you know better ways, I’m listening. How did Microsoft secure a monopoly on the PC desktop, creating multiple billion-dollar fortunes, and ensuring a tech hegemony that has lasted decades? Briefly: Bill Gates came from wealthy Seattle aristocracy. During the early eighties, his mother served on the executive committee of the United Way, along with IBM’s then CEO John Opel. This allowed William Henry Gates III (her son) to score a meeting with IBM about providing a code compiler for IBM’s new, epoch-making product, the IBM PC. What IBM really wanted, though, was an operating system, the core code that manages memory and runs programs. Gates, whose nascent company, Microsoft, didn’t have anything like an entire operating system, honestly referred IBM to a company run by Gary Kildall, a pioneer in operating systems when the real money in computers was still in the hardware. In a story couched in legend, Kildall was off flying his personal plane when IBM representatives physically came knocking at his company’s office. His wife (the company’s business manager) refused to sign IBM’s aggressive nondisclosure agreement and sent them packing, and so IBM grudgingly went back to Gates asking about operating systems. Gates, smelling an opportunity, offered to provide one, hiring a local Seattle programmer to clone Kildall’s operating system, then called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System), which eventually shipped in the IBM PC as DOS (Disk Operating System). Gates, correctly suspecting that other hardware companies would copy IBM’s approach of bundling software separately from hardware, retained copyright over this hacked and copied DOS. As a result, the proceeds from the new computing world where hardware was interchangeable, but software was not (rather than the reverse, which was the status quo in 1980), accrued to Gates and Microsoft rather than IBM. That licensing arrangement became what we now know as Microsoft, as it grew to provide everything from word processing (can we still use that term?) to browsers, calendars, and all the rest of the worker-bee software armamentarium. And Kildall? IBM eventually threw him a bone by offering his (original) operating system alongside Microsoft’s, but it was too little, too late, and it flopped. Fast-forward thirty-five years: Gates now tours Africa as a great philanthropist and single-handedly cures malaria. Kildall eventually succumbed to alcoholism, dying in mysterious circumstances—probably a drunken brawl—in a Monterrey biker bar at age fifty-two. To quote Balzac, “The secret of great fortunes without apparent cause is a forgotten crime, as the crime was properly done.” Never was a crime better concealed. Steve Jobs? If I were to even attempt a brief account of Jobs’s crimes, based on his well-documented biographies, it would fill the rest of the book. A representative anecdote: In 1975 Steven Jobs was a (literally) smelly hippie, fresh from a religious pilgrimage to India, working as a low-level technician at Atari. He was an arrogant, destructive presence who pissed off everyone except Atari’s CEO, Nolan Bushnell, who was impressed with Jobs’s wide-ranging intellect and saved him from being fired. Bushnell wanted to turn Pong, the legendary two-player game that launched the video game revolution, into a single-player version that would eventually be called Breakout (older readers will surely remember). Back in the day, a new game required hardware as well as software, with the former being more important. Bushnell announced a $700 prize for anyone who could design a hardware-software combo that would power the game, with a $1,000 bonus for every chip that was saved in manufacturing the circuit (chips used to be expensive). Jobs convinced his eventual Apple cofounder, Steve “Woz” Wozniak, to take on the project, stipulating it had to be done in four days to fit his social schedule (he had to go pick apples at a utopian commune). Woz worked like hell, with Jobs doing the manual labor of testing the designed circuits, and they made the deadline. Jobs, however, never told Woz about the bonuses, having mentioned only the base prize. He gave Woz $350, shortchanging his collaborator, who had made the entire thing possible, and used the stolen cash to finance his lifestyle. Steve Jobs was all smoldering ambition, ruthless will to power, and narcissistic amour propre; by all accounts of people who actually worked with him, he was a mediocre engineer who had good taste and knew how to recognize in others talents he didn’t posses, and got them to work like hell for him, while fending off competitors in the meantime. In that sense, he was the absolute exemplar of your successful startup CEO, even if not in the way people commonly think. Oh, and Zuckerberg? As is now public record, the Facebook idea (not that ideas alone are worth much) was stolen from a pack of entitled Ivy League brats (now notable angel investors) who had contracted him to implement it. He implemented, but then decided he rather liked the idea and ran with it. Eventually, Facebook would pay tens of millions in damages to the aforementioned Ivy Leaguers (though not without evidently shortchanging them even in the settlement).* We can come down from the rarefied heights of Gates and Jobs now. You’ll have to trust me on this: the story of just about every early-stage startup is peppered with tales such as mine. (Location 2007)</li>
<li>In the startup game, there are no real rules, only laws, and weakly enforced ones at that. In the end, success would forgive any sins, as it did for Gates and Jobs, and continues to do for countless startup entrepreneurs. Do we begrudge David the use of his sling, after all, against the towering giant Goliath? (Location 2055)</li>
<li>There are two weak points for tech companies, no matter how large: their investors and their potential business partners. The former influence even obdurate company leaders both by personal sway and by the fact that they often occupy voting seats on the board. If the founders lack leverage at fund-raising time, the CEO will be outnumbered on the board, and he serves at the pleasure of voting board members. This is how CEOs get voted out of office, like prime ministers via a no-confidence vote in parliamentary democracies. If keeping your job depends on pleasing someone else, even if your business card says “CEO,” you’ve got a collar around your neck attached to a leash, and that leash can be yanked. The other weakness is potential business partners. Shipping new product is one thing, but deals are where the startup rubber hits the revenue road. If the product is enterprise software, as it was for Adchemy, that meant a handful of deals a year was the company’s entire commercial livelihood. A few big contracts, and that’s what sustained the long-term value. If these were partnerships rather than deals—that is, an almost matrimonial coupling between (usually) a larger company and a smaller—then the stakes were even higher. These partnerships, like some potential royal marriage, hinged on a delicate combination of greed, long-term strategy, and a certain mutual seduction. Ugly realities like lawsuits, no matter how petty, dissolved the magic, and would send the more powerful partner fleeing. Even large companies with billions in capital fear public shaming and legal quagmires. (Location 2064)</li>

But if you have no cofounders, or if that band-of-brothers relationship isn’t there, then the only thing keeping the whole construct going is sheer, stubborn bloody-mindedness. (Location 2251)</li>

<li>Inside the Y Combinator lair, a faded drawing on a whiteboard faced the main dining/meeting hall. It featured the simple L shape of X and Y axes, along with a squiggle running from left to right accounting for the passage of time. The height represented how well a startup was doing, and the shape started with a sharp rise from zero, cresting to an apex labeled “Launch!” The peak was followed by a sudden crash and then a low plateau that ran almost the length of the plot. After much flatlining, the curve edged up slightly, before dipping again (label: “misconfigured analytics code”), and then increased at a steady pace until “acquisition.” The big, yawning space between launch peak and gradual takeoff was labeled ominously in large letters: “THE TROUGH OF DESPAIR.” Put yourself in the mind of a startup founder for a moment: You’ve managed to cobble together a product and maybe some VC money. You’ve launched, gotten a wave of PR, and everything is firing on all cylinders. You open the analytics dashboard that tracks usage, and you see what seems like an ocean of interested users clicking around and toying with every hard-fought feature you managed to ship. Then a few weeks go by. The media cycle has moved on to other new, shiny things. Your analytics graphs look like the heart-rate monitor on a heart attack victim. New user sign-ups have slowed to the trickle they were prelaunch. (Location 2343)</li>
<li>There are infinite reasons for not making it across the trough, but it almost always involves some impediment to paying users being scalably acquired or serviced. What’s the solution? The trendy answer is that you need to find what’s called “product-market fit,” which is a fancy way of saying that you need to build a thing people are willing to pay for. It turns out that’s pretty hard, because you don’t know what people will pay for until you ask them to, and if what you’re building is truly novel, there’s no history for you to go on. Fortunately, the iteration cycle in a software business is fast (we don’t need to retool milling machines here), and from some approximately correct starting point we can converge on a final product, almost like successive guesses at the solution to an equation. The quicker we iterate, the more steps we can take in the direction of this mythical point of perfect fit. Each such step costs money in wages, server costs, and lost time. When that cash balance goes to zero, the game is over and we’ve lost. If, however, we get close enough to that perfect product-market fit, in which users pay more money for the product than it costs to operate (and than it cost to acquire those users to begin with), we’ve escaped the financial free fall.

Do they know your dipshit douche friends you maintain for career reasons, or the ones you actually respect? As true now as in Machiavelli’s time, men are judged by the company they keep. Where do they hang out? Cheap tastes or expensive? Do they have that “lean and hungry look” of Cassius in Julius Caesar, and eat at dingy taquerias, or perhaps live off cheap staples like ramen or food substitutes? Those are the truly dangerous ones, the ones who live like organized crime trigger men, guerrilla fighters, or sailors at sea—eating shitty food and living in cheap, dumpy crash pads—and who couldn’t give a damn about quality of life.* Those are the people to fear, because they don’t need anything an antagonist can deprive them of.

The perfect is very often the enemy of the good, and as the Facebook poster screamed from every wall: DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT. Very few companies have died due to launching early; at worst, you’ll have a onetime product embarrassment (as Apple did with the first version of its iPhone Maps app).

<li>What’s an IPO, exactly? A company decides it wants to “float” part of its equity on the public markets, allowing employees and founders to sell private shares to pay them off for years of service, as well as sell shares out of the corporate treasury to have some money in the bank. Large investment banks (such as my former employer Goldman Sachs) form what’s called a “syndicate” (“mafia” might be a better term) wherein they offer to effectively buy those shares from Facebook, and then sell them into the capital markets, usually by pushing it via their sales force onto wealthy clients or institutional investors. That syndicate either guarantees a price (“firm commitment”) or promises to get the best price it can (“best effort”). In the former case, the bank is taking real execution risk, and stands to lose money if it doesn’t engineer a “pop” in the stock on opening day. To mitigate the risk, the bank convinces the offering company to expect a lower price, while simultaneously jacking up what real price the market will bear with a zealous sales pitch to the market’s deepest pockets. Thus, it is absolutely jejune to think that a stock’s rise on opening day is due to clamoring and unexpected interest. (Location 5546)</li>
<li>How does the first price of the day in IBM get set?

Modern electronic exchanges have replaced the manual process with an algorithmic one, but it’s essentially the same. On opening, trading initiates smoothly from a stew of overnight speculation and imaginary price movements into real trades and shares changing hands.
