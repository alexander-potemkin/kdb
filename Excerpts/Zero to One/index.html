<ul>
<li>The easiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to do it by yourself. (Location 150)</li>
<li>Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can. (Location 154)</li>
<li>In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. (Location 405)</li>
<li>Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. (Location 406)</li>
<li>Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits. (Location 407)</li>
<li>Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better. (Location 417)</li>
<li>Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. (Location 430)</li>
<li>in business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death. (Location 437)</li>
<li>In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not a pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business. (Location 441)</li>
<li>All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. (Location 445)</li>
<li>Our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves allow precise measurement of each student’s competitiveness; pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials. We teach every young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality. (Location 459)</li>
<li>If you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you. (Location 521)</li>
<li>a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. (Location 584)</li>
<li>Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future. (Location 597)</li>
<li>If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? (Location 617)</li>
<li>Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding. (Location 621)</li>
<li>positioning as a maker of premium goods, and the lingering (Location 679)</li>
<li>it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is. (Location 701)</li>
<li>Small doesn’t mean nonexistent. (Location 702)</li>
<li>It was much easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals. (Location 708)</li>
<li>The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. (Location 709)</li>
<li>This is why it’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. (Location 711)</li>
<li>Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. (Location 715)</li>
<li>The overall dynamic was net positive, (Location 755)</li>
<li>As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible. (Location 756)</li>
<li>But moving first is a tactic, not a goal. (Location 759)</li>
<li>But moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. (Location 759)</li>
<li>The way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from there, toward your ambitious long-term vision. (Location 762)</li>
<li>Malcolm Gladwell, a successful author who writes about successful people, (Location 770)</li>
<li>everyone agreed that you should do what you could, not focus on what you couldn’t. (Location 792)</li>
<li>Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one. (Location 811)</li>
<li>Optimists welcome the future; pessimists fear it. (Location 816)</li>
<li>Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world; China is the only country afraid that it won’t. (Location 831)</li>
<li>authority, people took the Reber Plan seriously. (Location 862)</li>
<li>Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find the global maximum. (Location 1004)</li>
<li>Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best. (Location 1007)</li>
<li>What would it mean to prioritize design over chance? (Location 1009)</li>
<li>It’s true that every great entrepreneur is first and foremost a designer. (Location 1011)</li>
<li>“spray and pray” (Location 1075)</li>
<li>And once you think that you’re playing the lottery, you’ve already psychologically prepared yourself to lose. (Location 1100)</li>
<li>However, you can’t trust a world that denies the power law to accurately frame your decisions for you, so what’s most important is rarely obvious. (Location 1156)</li>
<li>The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will yield only to relentless searchers. (Location 1287)</li>
<li>Great companies can be built on open but unsuspected secrets about how the world works. (Location 1294)</li>
<li>So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not telling you? (Location 1306)</li>
<li>But you could also take the human approach and ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists downplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically exaggerate their uniqueness. (Location 1319)</li>
<li>The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. (Location 1322)</li>
<li>high cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it already exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future. (Location 1457)</li>
<li>But even so-called incentive pay encourages short-term thinking and value grabbing. Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future. (Location 1459)</li>
<li>Since it’s impossible to achieve perfect fairness when distributing ownership, founders would do well to keep the details secret. (Location 1471)</li>
<li>It’s not liquid like cash. It’s tied to one specific company. And if that company doesn’t succeed, it’s worthless. Equity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations. Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to increasing your company’s value in the future. Equity can’t create perfect incentives, but it’s the best way for a founder to keep everyone in the company broadly aligned. (Location 1476)</li>
<li>A startup is a team of people on a mission, (Location 1502)</li>
<li>Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. (Location 1516)</li>
<li>there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. (Location 1535)</li>
<li>there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you (Location 1535)</li>
<li>there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you (Location 1535)</li>
<li>there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your mission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it’s important in general, but why you’re doing something important that no one else is going to get done. (Location 1535)</li>
<li>Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people. (Location 1543)</li>
<li>Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people. You probably can’t be the Google of 2014 in terms of compensation or perks, but you can be like the Google of 1999 if you already have good answers about your mission and team. (Location 1543)</li>
<li>Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people. You probably can’t be the Google of 2014 in terms of compensation or perks, but you can be like the Google of 1999 if you already have good answers about your mission and team. (Location 1543)</li>
<li>From the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way. (Location 1547)</li>
<li>The startup uniform encapsulates a simple but essential principle: everyone at your company should be different in the same way—a tribe of like-minded people fiercely devoted to the company’s mission. (Location 1551)</li>
<li>For the company to work, it didn’t matter what people looked like or which country they came from, but we needed every new hire to be equally obsessed. (Location 1560)</li>
<li>On the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work. (Location 1562)</li>
<li>advertising doesn’t exist to make you buy a product right away; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. (Location 1616)</li>
<li>All salesmen are actors: their priority is persuasion, not sincerity. (Location 1625)</li>
<li>Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution—whether they’re in sales, marketing, or advertising—has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising are called “account executives.” People who sell customers work in “business development.” People who sell companies are “investment bankers.” And people who sell themselves are called “politicians.” There’s a reason for these redescriptions: none of us wants to be reminded when we’re being sold. (Location 1632)</li>
<li>The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it. (Location 1641)</li>
<li>If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, (Location 1648)</li>
<li>Businesses with complex sales models succeed if they achieve 50% to 100% year-over-year growth over the course of a decade. (Location 1672)</li>
<li>In between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional advertising (no salespeople required) there is a dead zone. (Location 1697)</li>
<li>why so many small and medium-sized businesses don’t use tools (Location 1703)</li>
<li>distribution is the hidden bottleneck. (Location 1704)</li>
<li>Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished. (Location 1754)</li>
<li>You must also sell your company to employees and investors. (Location 1758)</li>
<li>Selling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else. (Location 1762)</li>
<li>AS MATURE INDUSTRIES stagnate, information technology has advanced so rapidly that it has now become synonymous with “technology” itself. (Location 1775)</li>
<li>Now think about the prospect of competition from computers instead of competition from human workers. (Location 1814)</li>
<li>you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful than each other—they’re categorically different. (Location 1823)</li>
<li>But the most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems? (Location 1904)</li>
<li>Technology is supposed to increase our mastery over nature and reduce the role of chance in our lives; (Location 1911)</li>
<li>seven questions that every business must answer: 1. The Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 2. The Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business? 3. The Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 4. The People Question Do you have the right team? 5. The Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 6. The Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 7. The Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see? (Location 1939)</li>
<li>THE ENGINEERING QUESTION A great technology company should have proprietary technology an order of magnitude better than its nearest substitute. (Location 1960)</li>
<li>Entering a slow-moving market can be a good strategy, but only if you have a definite and realistic plan to take it over. (Location 1983)</li>
<li>But you can’t dominate a submarket if it’s fictional, and huge markets are highly competitive, not highly attainable. (Location 2013)</li>
<li>THE DURABILITY QUESTION Every entrepreneur should plan to be the last mover in her particular market. That starts with asking yourself: what will the world look like 10 and 20 years from now, and how will my business fit in? (Location 2046)</li>
<li>Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see. (Location 2080)</li>
<li>only a firm that offers a superior solution for a specific energy problem can make money. (Location 2151)</li>
<li>a valuable business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market. (Location 2156)</li>
<li>Jobs’s return to Apple 12 years later shows how the most important task in business—the creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula and applied by professionals. (Location 2300)</li>
<li>The lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism. (Location 2309)</li>
<li>Above all, don’t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are important not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather because a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company. (Location 2314)</li>
<li>Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. (Location 2363)</li>
