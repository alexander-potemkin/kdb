MORE VALUE COMING SOON

If you've ever purchased a gadget or device in its “1.0” version, or been involved in the selection of enterprise software such as Salesforce or Oracle, you've experienced the power of the promise of new features as a retention hook. Communicating to customers that some new features or product offerings are just around the corner, and telling them how they'll benefit, can be a powerful inducement for them to stick with you. This works particularly well for SaaS products, videogames, and content providers like Hulu and HBO. Netflix uses this tactic effectively in spacing out the release of new seasons of their original series like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black to make sure you keep your subscription active as you await the next show to binge-watch. Salesforce similarly holds the release of their big product updates to new yearly events—one in the summer and one in the winter—to keep customers subscribed with the promise of must-have new features. Apple, too, has employed the tactic brilliantly, by keeping customers anxiously awaiting the day when they can upgrade to the shiniest new object the company puts out.

THE PRINCIPLE OF RECIPROCITY

In essence, this is the principle that we as humans are hardwired to return a favor.

THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL PROOF

The desire to follow social norms or conform to the behavior of others is among the most powerful motivators to purchase. Cialdini highlights the case of Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (England's version of the IRS), who in 2009 faced an incredible amount of unpaid debts from citizens behind on their taxes. Their collection efforts in the form of mailings were proving ineffective, so the HMRC teamed up with Cialdini's coauthor Steve Martin to try a new approach leveraging the power of social proof that proved incredibly simple and effective. The HMRC added a single sentence to the collection letters to a pilot group of delinquent taxpayers: a statement of the fact that most UK residents pay their taxes fully and on time. As a result, collections jumped from 57 to 86 percent in the pilot group, which added up to collections of 560 million pounds (out of the outstanding 650 million pounds) of tax money. Simply reminding people of the

social norms around paying their taxes produced a staggering improvement.18

THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY

Research shows that we are more likely to trust experts and people in positions of authority than an average person. Even the inclusion of subtle language that indicates authority can increase purchase behavior, as Kaya Skin Clinic proved when they generated a 22 percent increase in sales simply by adding the word expert to their call to action on their website, which then read “I want an expert

opinion. Sign me up!”22

The principle of authority explains why one out of every four television commercials features celebrity endorsements, and why brands founded by celebrities—like actress Jessica Alba's Honest Company—have been so successful. Depending on your industry and budget, celebrity endorsements may be out of scope, but each niche has influencers and tastemakers who have credibility within the audiences you're targeting. Growth teams can experiment with featuring such influencers to drive improved revenue growth through the principle of authority.

THE PRINCIPLE OF LIKING

We also buy more when a product or service is recommended by people we like. Airbnb leveraged the principle of liking when they reengineered their friend referral program by including a photo of the person sending the referral with the

invite. The addition of this personal touch was part of the reason why their new referral program saw a 300 percent increase per day in sign-ups and nights

booked from friend referrals to Airbnb.23

If you're looking for experiments to try to leverage the principle of liking, consider using images of real people—like your salespeople, or your customers —on your website. In addition, friendly, welcoming copy on your landing pages can trigger a similar response. Recall how Nasty Gal's founder, Sophia Amoruso, took poorly selling items and styled them on the site's most popular models to stoke sales? This is liking in action. The good news is that many of these changes don't require massive technical overhauls, and can be quick experiments the growth team can run to generate higher volume or purchases or to drive people to higher-priced items.

SWIMMING WITH SHARKS

Certain species of sharks must always keep moving to survive; if they stop swimming, they literally die. Growth teams are like those sharks. Teams that aren't constantly innovating, that aren't continuously diving into customer data and surveying, and that aren't rapidly experimenting and producing results are not long for the world.
