## Highlights
- life is too short for bad products. (Page 10)
- I do not believe inspiring products happen by accident. In every case, behind every successful, inspiring product, I find that there are certain truths. Here are ten such truths that I try to keep in mind on every product effort: 1. The job of the product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible. 2. Product discovery is a collaboration between the product manager, interaction designer, and software architect. 3. Engineering is important and difficult, but user experience design is even more important, and usually more difficult. 4. Engineers are typically very poor at user experience design—engineers think in terms of implementation models, but users think in terms of conceptual models. 5. User experience design means both interaction design and visual design (and for hardware-based devices, industrial design). 6. Functionality (product requirements) and user experience design are inherently intertwined. 7. Product ideas must be tested—early and often—on actual target users in order to come up with a product that is valuable and usable. 8. We need a high-fidelity prototype so we can quickly, easily, and frequently test our ideas on real users using a realistic user experience. 1. The job of the product manager is to identify the minimal possible product that meets the objectives—valuable, usable and feasible—minimizing time to market and user complexity. 2. Once this minimal successful product has been discovered and validated, it is not something that can be piecemealed and expect the same results (Page 12)
- Product Manager The product manager has two key responsibilities: assessing product opportunities, and defining the product to be built. Typically, new ideas can come from anywhere—company executives, discussions with customers, usability testing, your own product team, your sales or marketing staff, industry analysts, to name a few. But then someone needs to take a hard look at the idea and decide if it is something worth pursuing. The product manager is responsible for this assessment (many companies call this an MRD—Market Requirements Document—but I’ll describe a lighter-weight version of this called an Opportunity Assessment). Once you’ve decided that you have a good opportunity and your company is well-suited to pursue it, then someone needs to discover what the solution—the product—actually is, including the necessary features and functionality, the user (Page 16)
- experience, and the release criteria. Again, this someone is the product manager, and this task is the heart of his or her job. Some companies call this spec a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and others call it a Product Spec or Functional Spec. Again, I’ll advocate a lighter-weight approach that’s based on prototypes and not paper, but the key is that it describes the functionality and behavior of the product to be built, and not how it will be implemented (Page 17)
- User Experience Designer There are actually several roles within the user experience design organization and I’ll dive into more detail later on each of these. The key role here is the interaction designer (also known as information architect, user interface designer, and user experience architect). These people are responsible for developing a deep understanding of the target users (each persona that you’re trying to satisfy in your product), and coming up with the tasks, navigation, and flow that are both usable and productive. The interaction designer works closely with the product manager to discover the blend of requirements and design that meet the needs of the user. The idea is to get to the point where the software is both usable (users can figure out how to use it) and valuable (users actually want to use it). Project Management Once the product has been defined, the product development team will take on the project and begin building the product. The project scheduling and tracking function is the core of project management. There are several different models regarding who exactly handles the scheduling and tracking. Sometimes it is managed by dedicated project managers, sometimes by the engineering manager (since most of the resources are usually from his or her team), and in some cases the product manager is asked to project manage as well. It often depends more on the culture of the company and the size of the project. Larger projects especially benefit from a dedicated and skilled project manager. (Page 17)

- Engineering Also known as product development or software developers these are the people (Page 17)
- responsible for actually building the product. In some companies this is called “IT” (information technology), but it’s important to draw a distinction between the software created for customers and the software created for internal use such as an HR application. IT is typically the group that supports internal employees, and the engineering organization builds and maintains products for external customers (Page 18)
- Product Marketing The product marketing team member is responsible for telling the world about the product, managing the external-facing product launch, providing tools for the sales channel to market and sell the product, and for leading key programs such as online marketing campaigns and influencer marketing programs. Often companies ask the same person to cover both the product management (product definition) and the product marketing responsibilities. This can be difficult since the skills required are very different, but nevertheless it occurs at many companies (Page 20)
