[Amazon’s 14 Leadership Principles](https://www.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/our-leadership-principles)

* **Customer Obsession.** Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
* **Ownership.** Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
* **Invent and Simplify.** Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
* **Are Right, A Lot.** Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
* **Learn and Be Curious.** Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
* **Hire and Develop the Best.** Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
* **Insist on the Highest Standards.** Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
* **Think Big.** Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
* **Bias for Action.** Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
* **Frugality.** Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
* **Earn Trust.** Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
* **Dive Deep.** Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
* **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit.** Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
* **Deliver Results.** Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

* **We build globally, we live locally.** We harness the power and scale of our global operations to deeply connect with the cities, communities, drivers and riders that we serve, every day.
* **We are customer obsessed.**  We work tirelessly to earn our customers’ trust and business by solving their problems, maximizing their earnings or lowering their costs. We surprise and delight them. We make short-term sacrifices for a lifetime of loyalty.
* **We celebrate differences.** We stand apart from the average. We ensure people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome. We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build.
* **We do the right thing.** Period.

* **We persevere.** We believe in the power of grit. We don’t seek the easy path. We look for the toughest challenges and we push. Our collective resilience is our secret weapon.
* **We value ideas over hierarchy.** We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. Our job is to seek out those ideas, to shape and improve them through candid debate, and to take them from concept to action.
* **We make big bold bets.** Sometimes we fail, but failure makes us smarter. We get back up, we make the next bet, and we go!

### Stripe

[A quick guide to Stripe’s culture](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture#culture)

* **WE HAVEN’T WON YET.** People often worry that they’re joining Stripe, or any nascently successful startup, too late. Have all the large problems been solved? Are there still important decisions left to be made and things to be built?
* **MOVE WITH URGENCY AND FOCUS.** Our users entrust us with their money, their businesses, and their livelihoods. Millions of businesses around the world (individuals, startups, and large enterprises) are open for business only if we are. When we mess up, miss a deadline, or slow down, it matters. We take that responsibility seriously.
* **THINK RIGOROUSLY.** We care about being right and it often takes reasoning from first principles to get there.

* **“We” Not “I”** _._ Leadership at Dropbox gets described with a slew of adjectives that never come close to the word “boss.” The emphasis on support and training—along with open communication lines—means that micro- and macro-level feedback cater to individuals and teams. However, conversations aren’t limited to crunch time, giving employees no-pressure opportunities to discuss professional development and life outside the office.
* **Bringing a Whole Self to Work.** The idea of employees bringing their whole selves to work means team members get to bring their diverse interests and passions to the table, which adds to the culture. For example, the crew regularly heads out for communal lunches, summer picnics, boat rides, and board game nights.

The company addresses this need through a corporate culture that rewards constant innovation. Managers motivate employees to contribute to constant innovation in business processes and output.
* **Reason from “First Principles.** _”_ CEO Elon Musk promotes reasoning from first principles.

### Atlassian

[Atlassian company values](https://www.atlassian.com/company/values)

* **Open company, no bullshit.** Openness is root level for us. Information is open internally by default and sharing is a first principle. And we understand that speaking your mind requires equal parts brains (what to say), thoughtfulness (when to say it), and caring (how it’s said).
* **Build with heart and balance.** “Measure twice, cut once.” Whether you're building a birdhouse or a business, this is good advice. Passion and urgency infuse everything we do, alongside the wisdom to consider options fully and with care. Then we make the cut, and we get to work.
* **Don’t # @!% the customer.** Customers are our lifeblood. Without happy customers, we’re doomed. So considering the customer perspective - collectively, not just a handful - comes first.
* **Play, as a team.** We spend a huge amount of our time at work. So the more that time doesn’t feel like “work,” the better. We can be serious, without taking ourselves too seriously. We strive to put what’s right for the team first – whether in a meeting room or on a football pitch.
* **Be the change you seek.** All Atlassians should have the courage and resourcefulness to spark change – to make better our products, our people, our place. Continuous improvement is a shared responsibility. Action is an independent one.

### Patreon

[Patreon Culture Deck](https://patreonhq.com/how-to-build-culture-that-lasts-dc25b086cefd) 

* **Put creators first.** Deliver unusual care to creators. Our business is creators' income and rent checks, so we do not take our responsibility lightly. We exist because of, and in service of, creators. There is a creator behind every text, email, call, request, bug and payment issue, and we treat them as human beings, not users. We will fight to keep the human spark in our relationship as we scale. As a business we invest in teams like Community Happiness and Creator Care who are on the front lines taking care of our creators. We revere these teammates on the front lines.
* **Be an energy giver.** Inspire those around you with a possible attitude. Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer says "Every individual on every team I've coached can be divided into 1 of 2 categories: an energy giver and energy taker". Be an energy giver. Enegry giver does not mean that Patreon only hires outgoing people.
* **Be candid, always.** Be extremely caring and extremely direct in all you do at Patreon, especially when it comes to giving positive or constructive feedback. Our candor and open feedback culture is what sets us apart from most teams. We expect you to speak up and have hard conversations regularly in order to helo your teammates grow.
* **Move fast as hell.** We need to move fast because our creators and patrons need so much more value from us. This is why we talk in terms of hypotheses, experiments and learning. This is why we're constantly checking our work with quantitative and qualitative data. We need to balance delivering value in the short term with investing in infrastructure, tools. and teams that speed us up over time. We have to make great choices about which work will be most impactful. The world will judge us not by how much ve get done byt by how much value we deliverr to creators. So we must ruthlessly prioritize and focus on learning what is valuable as quickly as possible.
* **Seek learning.** We want to surround ourselves wiith people who are obsessed with learning and development.

	* Patreon will pay for you to take the extra class or attend the workshop. Investing in you is the best investment Patreon can make.
	* Our employee handbook has all of the details about our learning benefits.
	* We recommend you find several mentors, both internally and externally. Ask your manager for help finding a mentor if you have trouble and we will do our best to connect you with someone you look up to.

* **Respect your teammates' time.** We are students of communication. We place high value on clear and succinct communicators. Time is our most precious resource and we treat it that way. In order to move fast as hell, we need to respect each other's time. When it comes to our work, if you can have a conversation in two minutes instead of ten, we expect it to happen in two minutes. Do not be long-winded. Think about what you need to say before approaching a teammate.
* **Just fix it.** Seek to define the undefined. Some things at Patreon are defined well and some things are not. If you find something that could use more definition that could use more definition, please bring solutions to the table with a positive attitude. Hunt for ways to improve our company and our product. You can either complain when somenthing is broken, or fix it.

### Google

[Ten things we know to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html)

* **Focus on the user and all else will follow.** Since the beginning, we’ve focused on providing the best user experience possible. Whether we’re designing a new Internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the homepage, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our own internal goal or bottom line. Our homepage interface is clear and simple, and pages load instantly. Placement in search results is never sold to anyone, and advertising is not only clearly marked as such, it offers relevant content and is not distracting. And when we build new tools and applications, we believe they should work so well you don’t have to consider how they might have been designed differently.
* **It’s best to do one thing really, really well.** We do search. With one of the world’s largest research groups focused exclusively on solving search problems, we know what we do well, and how we could do it better. Through continued iteration on difficult problems, we’ve been able to solve complex issues and provide continuous improvements to a service that already makes finding information a fast and seamless experience for millions of people. Our dedication to improving search helps us apply what we’ve learned to new products, like Gmail and Google Maps. Our hope is to bring the power of search to previously unexplored areas, and to help people access and use even more of the ever-expanding information in their lives.
* **Fast is better than slow.** We know your time is valuable, so when you’re seeking an answer on the web you want it right away–and we aim to please. We may be the only people in the world who can say our goal is to have people leave our website as quickly as possible. By shaving excess bits and bytes from our pages and increasing the efficiency of our serving environment, we’ve broken our own speed records many times over, so that the average response time on a search result is a fraction of a second. We keep speed in mind with each new product we release, whether it’s a mobile application or Google Chrome, a browser designed to be fast enough for the modern web. And we continue to work on making it all go even faster.
* **Democracy on the web works.** Google search works because it relies on the millions of individuals posting links on websites to help determine which other sites offer content of value. We assess the importance of every web page using more than 200 signals and a variety of techniques, including our patented PageRank™ algorithm, which analyzes which sites have been “voted” to be the best sources of information by other pages across the web. As the web gets bigger, this approach actually improves, as each new site is another point of information and another vote to be counted. In the same vein, we are active in open source software development, where innovation takes place through the collective effort of many programmers.
* **You don’t need to be at your desk to need an answer.** The world is increasingly mobile: people want access to information wherever they are, whenever they need it. We’re pioneering new technologies and offering new solutions for mobile services that help people all over the globe to do any number of tasks on their phone, from checking email and calendar events to watching videos, not to mention the several different ways to access Google search on a phone. In addition, we’re hoping to fuel greater innovation for mobile users everywhere with Android, a free, open source mobile platform. Android brings the openness that shaped the Internet to the mobile world. Not only does Android benefit consumers, who have more choice and innovative new mobile experiences, but it opens up revenue opportunities for carriers, manufacturers and developers.
* **You can make money without doing evil.** Google is a business. The revenue we generate is derived from offering search technology to companies and from the sale of advertising displayed on our site and on other sites across the web. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use AdWords to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage of our AdSense program to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that we’re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising programs and practices:

	* We don’t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to find–so it’s possible that certain searches won’t lead to any ads at all.
	* We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We don’t accept pop–up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content you’ve requested. We’ve found that text ads that are relevant to the person reading them draw much higher clickthrough rates than ads appearing randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted medium.
	* Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a “Sponsored Link,” so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no one can buy better PageRank. Our users trust our objectivity and no short-term gain could ever justify breaching that trust.

* **There’s always more information out there.** Once we’d indexed more of the HTML pages on the Internet than any other search service, our engineers turned their attention to information that was not as readily accessible. Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases into search, such as adding a phone number and address lookup and a business directory. Other efforts required a bit more creativity, like adding the ability to search news archives, patents, academic journals, billions of images and millions of books. And our researchers continue looking into ways to bring all the world’s information to people seeking answers.
* **The need for information crosses all borders.** Our company was founded in California, but our mission is to facilitate access to information for the entire world, and in every language. To that end, we have offices in more than 60 countries, maintain more than 180 Internet domains, and serve more than half of our results to people living outside the United States. We offer Google’s search interface in more than 130 languages, offer people the ability to restrict results to content written in their own language, and aim to provide the rest of our applications and products in as many languages and accessible formats as possible. Using our translation tools, people can discover content written on the other side of the world in languages they don’t speak. With these tools and the help of volunteer translators, we have been able to greatly improve both the variety and quality of services we can offer in even the most far–flung corners of the globe.
* **You can be serious without a suit.** Our founders built Google around the idea that work should be challenging, and the challenge should be fun. We believe that great, creative things are more likely to happen with the right company culture–and that doesn’t just mean lava lamps and rubber balls. There is an emphasis on team achievements and pride in individual accomplishments that contribute to our overall success. We put great stock in our employees–energetic, passionate people from diverse backgrounds with creative approaches to work, play and life. Our atmosphere may be casual, but as new ideas emerge in a café line, at a team meeting or at the gym, they are traded, tested and put into practice with dizzying speed–and they may be the launch pad for a new project destined for worldwide use.
* **Great just isn’t good enough.** We see being great at something as a starting point, not an endpoint. We set ourselves goals we know we can’t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them we can get further than we expected. Through innovation and iteration, we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways. For example, when one of our engineers saw that search worked well for properly spelled words, he wondered about how it handled typos. That led him to create an intuitive and more helpful spell checker.
* Even if you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, finding an answer on the web is our problem, not yours. We try to anticipate needs not yet articulated by our global audience, and meet them with products and services that set new standards. When we launched Gmail, it had more storage space than any email service available. In retrospect offering that seems obvious–but that’s because now we have new standards for email storage. Those are the kinds of changes we seek to make, and we’re always looking for new places where we can make a difference. Ultimately, our constant dissatisfaction with the way things are becomes the driving force behind everything we do.
