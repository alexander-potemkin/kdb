In both cases, I realized I had worked far more effectively than in my normal daily routine or in any brainstorm workshop. What was different? First, there was time to develop ideas independently, unlike the shouting and pitching in a group brainstorm. But there wasn't too much time. Looming deadlines forced me to focus. I couldn't afford to overthink details or get caught up in other, less important work, as I often did on regular workdays. The other key ingredients were the people. The engineers, the product manager, and the designer were all in the room together, each solving his or her own part of the problem, each ready to answer the others' questions

I reconsidered those team workshops. What if I added these other magic ingredients—a focus on individual work, time to prototype, and an

inescapable deadline? I decided to call it a design “sprint.”

Bill was interested in the idea of running sprints with the startups in GV's portfolio. Startups usually get only one good shot at a successful product before they run out of money. Sprints could give these companies a way to find out if they were on the right track before they committed to the risky business of building and launching their products. There was money to be made, and saved, from running sprints.

With luck, you chose your work because of a bold vision. You want to deliver that vision to the world, whether it's a message or a service or an experience, software or hardware or even—as in the case of this book—a story or an idea. But bringing a vision to life is difficult. It's all too easy to get stuck in churn: endless email, deadlines that slip, meetings that burn up your day, and long-term projects based on questionable assumptions. It doesn't have to be that way. Sprints offer a path to solve big problems, test new ideas, get more done, and do it faster. They also allow you to have more fun along the way. In other words, you've absolutely got to try one for yourself. Let's get to work.

The sprint is GV's unique five-day process for answering crucial questions through prototyping and testing ideas with customers.

Good ideas are hard to find. And even the best ideas face an uncertain path to real-world success. That's true whether you're running a startup, teaching a class, or working inside a large organization.

Instead of waiting to launch a minimal product to understand if an idea is any good, our companies get clear data from a realistic prototype.

The sprint gives our startups a superpower: They can fast-forward into the future to see their finished product and customer reactions, before making any expensive commitments.

When a risky idea succeeds in a sprint, the payoff is fantastic. But it's the failures that, while painful, provide the greatest return on investment. Identifying critical flaws after just five days of work is the height of efficiency. It's learning the hard way, without the “hard way.”

solutions on paper. On Wednesday, you'll make difficult decisions and turn your ideas into a testable hypothesis. On Thursday, you'll hammer out a realistic prototype. And on Friday, you'll test it with real live humans.

When we talk to startups about sprints, we encourage them to go after their most important problem. Running a sprint requires a lot of energy and focus. Don't go for the small win, or the nice-to-have project, because people won't bring their best efforts. They probably won't even clear their schedules in the first place.

First, the sprint forces your team to focus on the most pressing questions. Second, the sprint allows you to learn from just the surface of a finished product.

The surface is important. It's where your product or service meets customers. Human beings are complex and fickle, so it's impossible to predict how they'll react to a brand-new solution. When our new ideas fail, it's usually because we were overconfident about how well customers would understand and how much they would care.

Highlight (color  #FACD5A ), Mobile User:

Get that surface right, and you can work backward to figure out the underlying systems or technology. Focusing on the surface allows you to move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution, which is why any challenge, no matter how large, can benefit from a sprint.

A sprint resembles that perfectly orchestrated heist. You and your team put your talents, time, and energy to their best use, taking on an overwhelming challenge and using your wits (and a little trickery) to overcome every obstacle that crosses your path. To pull it off, you need the right team. You shouldn't need a pickpocket, but you will need a leader and a set of diverse skills. To build the perfect sprint team, first you're going to need a Danny Ocean: someone with authority to make decisions. That person is the Decider, a role so important we went ahead and capitalized it. The Decider is the official decision-maker for the project. At many startups we work with, it's a founder or CEO. At bigger companies, it might be a VP, a product manager, or another team leader. These Deciders generally understand the problem in depth, and they often have strong opinions and criteria to help find the right solution.

Highlight (yellow):

If your Decider is reluctant, try one or more of these arguments:

Rapid Progress Emphasize the amount of progress you'll make in your sprint: In just one week, you'll have a realistic prototype. Some Deciders are not excited about customer tests (at least, until they see one firsthand), but almost everyone loves fast results.

It's an Experiment Consider your first sprint an experiment. When it's over, the Decider can help evaluate how effective it was. We've found that many people who are hesitant to change the way they work are open to a onetime experiment.

Explain the Tradeoffs Show the Decider a list of big meetings and work items you and your team will miss during the sprint week. Tell her which items you will skip and which you will postpone, and why.

It's About Focus Be honest about your motivations. If the quality of your work is suffering because your team's regular work schedule is too scattered, say so. Tell the Decider that instead of doing an okay job on everything, you'll do an excellent job on one thing.

If the Decider agrees to the sprint but can't spare a full week, invite her to join you at a few key points. On Monday, she can share her perspective on the problem. On Wednesday, she can help choose the right idea to test. And on Friday, she should stop by to see how customers react to the prototype. If she's only going to make cameo appearances, your Decider needs to have an official delegate in the room.

Highlight (yellow):

if your Decider doesn't believe the sprint to be worthwhile? If she won't even stop by for a cameo? Hold up! That's a giant red flag. You might have the wrong project. Take your time, talk with the Decider, and figure out which big challenge would be better.

Bring the troublemaker

Before every sprint, we ask: Who might cause trouble if he or she isn't included? We don't mean people who argue just for the sake of arguing. We mean that smart person who has strong, contrary opinions, and whom you might be slightly uncomfortable with including in your sprint. This advice is partially defensive. If the troublemaker is in the room, even just for a guest appearance, he or she will feel included and invested in the project. But there's a more important reason. Troublemakers see problems differently from everyone else. Their crazy idea about solving the problem might just be right. And even if it's wrong, the presence of a dissenting view will push everyone else to do better work. There's a fine line between a rebel and a jerk, of course, but don't avoid people just because they disagree with you.

We've found that magic happens when we use big whiteboards to solve problems. As humans, our short-term memory is not all that good, but our spatial memory is awesome. A sprint room, plastered with notes, diagrams, printouts, and more, takes advantage of that spatial memory. The room itself becomes a sort of shared brain for the team. As our friend Tim Brown, CEO of the design firm IDEO, writes in his book Change by Design: “The simultaneous visibility of these project materials helps us identify patterns and encourages creative synthesis to occur much more readily than when these resources are hidden away in file folders, notebooks, or PowerPoint decks.”
