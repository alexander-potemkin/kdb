# ## Startup School

Why did you pick this work:
I am tech and business oriented at the same time. Started few my own startups and feel the pain of building SW product where every cent counts. I like problem solving and I want to try to solve that business problem.
What is my company going to make:
Product that let startups very quickly and efficiently get they MVP, tech stacks and team that will help to grow quickly and cost efficient.
Why:
I am tech and business focused at the same time.
Started few my own startups as well as a co-founder and feel the pain of building SW product where every cent and day counts.
Would like to sort out this problem and provide a product for that.
Product
Product that let startups very quickly and efficiently get they MVP, tech stacks and team that will help to grow quickly and cost efficient.
Where I am
Have done few projects cost efficient; proved the concept, sales to the customers, development workflow. Needs to turn that into the scalable working business.
Building a startup is about solving a problem
Live in the future and build what’s missing -
Talk to users. Build product.
Find 100 people that love your product.
Just grow. 10% a week every week.
Passion vs curiosity and frustration
Talk to the users, don’t expect you know enough / everything; investors and experts are not expert in your product, as it never existed before, you are creating it.
Startup is not about building a product; it’s about solving a problem.
Money buys time, not the budget to spend on the product.
Focus on a weekly growth, not on a product launch/release; choose your (north star) metric and grow

Grow metrics YC: if you grow 5% week - that is 22% monthly, 12.6x yearly (7% / week => 33.7x / year; 10% / week => 142x / year)

Two key things to do:
* Just start
* Keep going
Find your people


## Weekly update questions

Make something people want
Are you launched?
Weeks to launch:
0 - 5 - almost there, looking for launch
5 - and more - That’s a long way out! Think hard: is there an MVP you could launch earlier?
How many (prospective) users have you talked this week:
< 5 - Talking to users is the best way to ensure you’re building the right thing. Don’t neglect it!
5 - Keep doing that
What are your 1-3 goals for the next week?
What have you learned from users?
What most changed your primary metric?
Biggest obstacle?
On a scale of 1-10, what is your morale?
1 - burned out / 10 - excited


## Product / Hypothesis

There is a reliable and quick way to launch and test hypothesis for my customers, that are doing pain killer products.
There are services to find and hire engineers, but not a CTO. Who is a CTO? Could there be a service to hire a CTO?
Shall it be a workflow / bot? If so - how would it be updated? Like a Wikipedia? If so, where is the monetization? Why will CTOs even think about it?
It could be a training, as an online incubator? Automated one, something on Coursera?


## Week 1

Goals:
1. Clearly formulate hypothesis to check.
2. Speak with at least 2 founders, who already launched they products - how did they address they needs.
3. Speak with at least 2 new founders (without startup implemented), regarding hypothesis checks and/or MVP implementation.
Considerations so far:
* people needs people
* constructors are keep appearing here and there, meaning there is a demand - a demand of what?
* founders often needs to choose proper tech. stack and tools
* founders needs process to be setup in a proper way (MVP, CI/CD, tickets, statuses, remote, hiring a team, people’s motivation and payments, time evaluation & resources management, features vs product hypothesis, etc - what exactly?)
* metrics in MVP, support
* remote is Ok (the question is about payments logistics)
* product could be a set of templates / quick starts for founders
* quite a lot of founders are looking for a technical founder → how do they choose one? they can’t evaluate them, and this should impact the business quite a lot → service to provide a proper CTO on board?
* technology could be of any level, but you need a guy who will think this technology - this tech. stack and this guy thinking ability will influence your startup quite dramatically
* all of my knowledge regarding RAD, apps builders - web & mobile, ShoutEm partner
* technical requirements - agile vs waterfall vs mix (book)
* ideal CTO - is the one, who doesn’t exist, but do the function - AI CTO, mix of app builder & a person → shall I start a bot?
* one stop for everything - CTO, angels, agreements, etc → that’s more like a incubator; could it be online / remote highly specific incubator? Automated incubator? Start anytime → course?
* coding? developers - is it a code? depends on the solution compexity; MVP ?must? be simple? RAT app, I guess, must?
* React seems to be on the rise, indeed → find full stack is on the rise article
* CTO as a service / team as a service
* If later, is it about doing an MVP? What are people’s fears? What founders are thinking about? What they want and what not? Risks and mitigation?
* CTO evaluation?

 [MVP Interview ](https://www.notion.so/MVP-Interview-04c9dd91e6554fb98f4754150b84cc43) 

Обратная связь от Кати:
Самое главное - это конкретика, результативность и релевантность к моему кейсу.
Конкретика - это то, что ты предложил конкретные вещи, шаги, а не просто вообщем типа сделай сайт/подумай об этом и тд.
Результативность - это то что эти шаги прямо такие, которые я прямо сегодня могу сделать и уже увидеть результат, то есть я как бы сегодня уже смогу продвинуть свою идею на шажочек вперед.
Плюс это шаги простые. то есть задача сделать сайт - это комплексно, сложно и долго, а сделать facebook group - это задача на 15 минут, то есть я результат увижу уже сегодня, а не когда то через месяц когда сделаю сайт.
То есть ты по сути упростил мне работу, а не усложнил ее.
Релевантность к моему кейсу - это то, что речь шла именно про мой кейс и решения были специфичными к моему кейсу, а не просто generic которые можно раздать кому угодно.
==
Развить в курс / что-то долгосрочное, когда человек проходит несколько этапов за какой-то период.
Человек должен получить кредит доверия - он должен понять что я что-то адекватное скажу.
В случае с Катей - помогла тусовка, пересечение по коллу, YC,
==
Негативный опыт - девушка всё сделала сама и помогала другим
Lead magnit - бесплатная консультация, не понравилось - generic и говорила больше про себя.
Большая боль у стартаперов и малых компаниях - окружение, где можно обсудить свои мысли и идеи.
Называется Mind Meister group. Может участвовать тренер в группах.
Рядом Random Coffee.
==
Наша консультация была в формате:
* какие у тебя гипотеза(-ы), которую ты хочешь проверить

* уточнение гипотезы

* Катя показала как бы она видела магазин - сделала на каком-то конструкторе + PowerPoint

* формирование всё более упрощающегося MVP

* take the article on MVP (en & ru)
Add calculator?
Small projects are a huge market share actually. A lot of people wants to start.
Problem getting money, when the user didn’t get what he/she expected. No money in they business, means troubles getting money for your business.
Looking for CTO - basically looking for MVP & engineer to start & good framework.

## How to talk to users

by Eric Migicovsky
Founder should maintain direct contact with the users. The best companies, are where CEO talk to the customers.
Only 2 things needs to be done at YC:
Write Code.
Talk to users.
To avoid common errors (from Mom's test):
1. Talk about user's life (do not sell your product)
2. Talk specifics (not hypotheticals, people are quite bad at predicting future)
3. Listen as much as you can (less talk, more listen).
5 great questions you can ask in your customer interview:
* what's the hardest part about what you are doing? (Dropbox example: how do you share files?)
* problems ideally be regular and painful, so check about last time the user faced the issue?
* why was this issue / circumstance hard? (Dropbox example: files duplicate via e-mail) Customer usually not buying 'what?', but 'why?'
* what if anything have you done to solve this problem? If the customer is not exploring for the potential solution, this could easily means that it's not that burning. If they are - you will discover the competitors of all kinds.
* what don't you love about the solutions that you tried? This could help with solution features.
Talking to users helps:
* idea stage → find users with that problem: friends, coworkers, intros; drop by in person (when cold e-mail / phone calls were not working) - try to showing up, that could just work; industry events. If you truly believe that you are solving people's problem, 15 minutes of people's time looks right.
* prototype → best first customer: who is your best first customer. If you choose your wrong first customer, this could make things harder. Questions to ask:
* how much does this problem cost them? Or how much problems they already spend on that?
* how frequent is the problem? If it's happening on a regular basis, that means the customer is interested in solving the problem.
* how large is they budget? Who is the person, making decision? Who has the power to make a decision. ROI, Frequency, Budget - the data that could be used to prfioritize the first customer.
* launched → product-market fit: make it customers pull the product from you.
 [How Superhuman Built an Engine to Find Product/Market Fit](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) 
How would you feel if you could no longer use Superhuman (from the link above):
a) very disappointed —> measure them, they value your product most; if it's more than 40% - your product will grow kind of automatically
b) Somewhat dissapointed
c) Not dissapointed
Tips:
* take notes
* keep if casual (nothing special, feel free to react)
* care about they time
* ask user’s for the phone during the sign-in - to get in touch with the customer to get more information
* don’t design the features as per user’s requests (or do it, if the customer will pay for the feature in advance)
* discard bad data - good example are ‘compliments’, ‘it would be good to have something’
Once you got a feedback, take some time & get back in a couple of days - please, check it out, it’s completely based on your feedback. Don’t do it immediately, this will produce a shock effect - like you did it for they purpose.
There is no product in production without bugs.
You spend your entire life in the company trying to get as much users, as you can.
Real world test, more interactions, …
Hopefully the product will be used by a million people; so if you loose some of them, that’s not a big deal - you will fix it later on.
How many interview has to be done before the build?
Do the interview unless you know the problem & ideally - speak & build in parallel.
When do you charge? As early as possible. If you can take a pre-order - perfect.
B2B complex solutions - go and sell first. If you can sell something without having it - that’s a very strong signal.
Listen and “yeah, we can build it” - customer shall believe that you can do it.
People can’t describe what they never seen.
MVP on a Shopify - like you customer can actually paying, at the end saying that “we accepting the payments in a couple of weeks”.
If your MVP takes a lot of work and resources, how do you do that? You can start with the customers from the day 1, how do they use they existing product, what’s the pains, try to sell. You can do so much with a landing page. Even a product demo could work.
At the early stage advertising is expensive. So… talk to users - that’s cheap. Could be ever door knocking or a digital equivalent of that.

## How to evaluate the startup idea
by Kevin Hale
How can I predict if investor will like my idea?
Company created to growth very quickly. Otherwise - it's a normal company, small business.
It's not about how to figure out what's wrong, but how could it possible win.
How this idea could possible became big. And then you convince a founder how it could be.
Your startups idea is a hypothesis - how to grow quickly. How to better construct the hypothesis? So that the investor will understand how it grow quickly.
Starts with the problem: what is the setting for the problem. Then comes the solution. Next comes the insight - why your experiment will became successful.
Good problems are popular. Lot’s of people have them. And the problem is growing and faster then others.
Investors like problems that are urgent (cause it will happen quickly), expensive (cause this will generate profit) and mandatory (people have to solve it) and frequent (over and over again).
Frequency is support important - as that gives a lot of opportunities to convert.
PG Fug, researcher at Stanford:
If you try to change someone’s behavious - you need to have 3 things to have in place: Motivation & Ability + Trigger.
Motivation - is the problem
Ability - is your startups
What is the trigger?
Quite often, when founders do a good product, and people are not using it, it’s because they believe that the customer do remember about they problem, so founders are not sending enough mail notification, triggers, reminders, follow up, triggering at the right time.
Ideal: 1M+ people have the problem, market is growing 20% a year, people want to solve that issue right now, $1B total addressable market, something people solve ever hour - multiple times per day.
Law change could be a good trigger.
Best advice from YC: don’t start here - SISP - Solution In Search of Problem, quite often happens with engineers wanting to use some problem. It’s possible, but super inefficient. Better start with people’s problems!
And getting back to the insight - what kind of unfair competitive advantage you have? Why you are going to win / will be the fastest.
This unfair advantage has to be related to the grow and you need to provide one - an explanation, so that investor won’t use his imagination, as it’s impossible.
Unfair advantages that your company could have (ideal - all of them, but at least - one):
* founders (1 of 10): are you super expert? 99% are not. There are a lot Product Managers, Engineers, etc.
* market: is it growing 20% a year? If it is - you are following a trend. It’s one of the weakest advantage, but it’s still an advantage.
* product: is it 10x better, than a competition?
* acquisition: ideal $0; if paid acquisition is your only channel and you grown into a big company, then you will attract a lot of competitors into the space, which will increase you acquisition cost and discount it’s use. Best way to grow - is a word of mouth. If you have no money - that’s a great exercise to grow without paid marketing.
* monopoly: yes / no; as your company grow, do you get stronger - network effects and market places are a good example (anti-fragile). Market places - are winner takes it all; network is when company grows with it’s network.
Beliefs:
1. Threshold - what is to succeed? Can they even build it? Can you sale?
2. Miracle - if you have that, customer’s will be like they have a super combo.
Problem, solution, unfair advantage.
Your startup idea - is a hypothesis, why you will grow quickly. How to verify it?

How Jason Cohen got his first 30 paying customers before even building his product.

His tactic was all about direct outreach. He'd go onto Linkedin, searched for Wordpress consultants (his target audience) and email them.

He had this one genius line in his emails where he'd say: **I'm very happy to pay whatever you think is fair for an hour of your time... Even if it’s more than your normal rate**

In saying this he signalled that he's:

• not a time-waster • fair to do business with

And out of the **40** emails he sent, **100%** agreed to talk to him on the phone! And none of them asked for any money

Greater clarity is needed on a) problem trying to solve, b) what you're proposing (based on where you are at with your business now) on how to solve it. Best wishes, as you progress towards your goal!

## Meeting 2

I'm dealing with my frustration on people, who's wasting money on something they believe is an MVP, while it's not.

This business is not about became an advisor (as it's not scalable). I don't like marketplace neither.

## How to plan an MVP

by Michael Seibel
One of the stupid startup jargon
Something ridiculously simple - that is the first thing you can give to the first first users, to see if you can deliver any value to them at all.
Talk to some users, before you decided to build an MVP. If you are your own user, you can eat your dog food and see if it works for you as well.
Where to get first users - talk to the users, who face the problem. If you are building a product for a mysterious users - think twice.
Goal of the pre-launch startup:
* launch (something bad) quickly (MVP) - the KEY thing;
* get initial customer - get anyone using your product - another KEY thing;
* talk to your users and get feedback; quite often full thing isn’t what you customer wants at all and full thing costs thousands of USD and tons of time, so you shouldn’t hesitate to show your sheety product, if helps people solve some issues (DropBox, AriBnB, example, etc.) - if people like your idea, they will help you and understand that it’s just a beggining;
* iterate vs pivoting - if the screwdriver doesn’t work for the mechanic, don’t try to use a screwdriver for something else - like for cooking, instead - keep the problem, keep the mechanic and fix a screwdriver - that’s the fix that broken - so, iterate, keep improving the solution, until it fixes the problem;
Lean MVP (in most cases) works:
* build it fast in a weeks, not months;
* very limited set of functionality;
* appeal to a small set of users - keep the vision, but focus on a small set at the beggining;
* base to iterate from - it’s just a starting point - it’s not special in any way.
AirBnB - no payments, no map view (list view), part time programmer
Twitch - some chat and some video, only 1 channel, low resolution vide, no video games
Stripe (was _dev_payments at the day 1) - no bank deals (very startupish way of processing - how?), almost no features, founders would come and integrate stripe for you at your office
Heavy MVP makes sense in a very few cases:
* if you are in industry with hard regulation (insurance, banking, etc) and it’s hard to launch due to that regulation;
* hardtech - you can’t build a rocket in a week
* biotech - hard to invent cancer drag in a week
* moonshot - hard to dig tunnels under the ground.
If you are in that case, your MVP can start with a simple site, that explains what you do.
Launching like big companies - doesn’t really works. Can you remember how Google, Facebook, Twitter launched? Nobody remember, there is nothing special in that.
Key thing in launching is to start getting customers
Learning from customer is easier with an MVP, than without. MVP is your assistant in speaking with the customer.
You can talk with the customer all day, but until he has a tool to play with, you can not know if it will work or not. If your customer can’t play with a thing, that makes your research much more complicated.
Altogether with your pitch deck, you should have an MVP to show to the customer.
Hacks for building an MVP quickly:
* Time box your spec - if you want to launch in a 3 weeks, you need to have something as easy and working in a 3 weeks;
* Write your spec - that is necessary when working with the team as well, so that everyone would be informed about the changes;
* Cut your spec - to match your deadline (step #1); the key goal - is to get something to the world. If you don’t have anything to the world - it’s very easy to just delay and delay.
* Don’t fall in love with your (they idea in they head) MVP, none of the project I have shown you before (Dropbox, AirBnB, other examples) - when the initial vision matches with what it ended up being.
Never ask users for features. It’s not users job to come up with the features (it’s yours), they job is to come with a problems (and money to pay for the resolution).
If person sneak into the features (like I would like to have MS Word, that would do …) - return him/her back with a question - ah, Ok, and what is the problem you have, that you need …
If you stuck in a cycle of changing your MVP, just start it. One of the reason you might want to keep changing your MVP, is because you can think it’s special, so just stop it. You do something, that you will destroy very quickly.
MVP shall answer a single question - does it solve the problem that I would like to solve? It’s either yes or not. If they returns for a solution for they daily issue - that’s a definitely yes.
pre-MVP stage: launch it, let’s see how it goes. No roadmap. Just solve what’s in front of you first.
post-MVP - shall you work on growth or on retention? Both. Startup is multi-variable problem - you had to keep it all (like taking a shower and cleaning your teeth). Keep it juggling.
How do you talk with your users, if they have a problem, they don’t want to talk about.
**How do you know if you have a product-market fit?** The classic answer is: if you are asking, you don’t have it. Basically, you have a product market fit, when people start using your product so much, that you transition from anything, to just keep it on-line (people starts to pull it from you) - your problem became on how to serve all of the people that will come tomorrow. And your startup going to die, because we have too many users. That’s how it tends to looks like. This way it’s not hard to differentiate. And the hard reality is that almost no one gets product-market fit.
What happens if you learn more about the problem and the problem starts to expand? That’s what it should be. But founder shouldn’t solve the problem for all users. You start with vision big, MVP small and grow. You investor and customer pitches are different.


## How to Set KPIs and Goals

by Adora Cheung

KPIs - set of metrics, indicating how healthy your business is doing.

Keeps your realistic + important feedback mechanism regarding your strategy - if you do something that it goes up - that's good, bad otherwise, most probably.

So, it's important to set them correctly.

What are the right KPIs to set - primary & secondary.

At SUS - it's just one metric.

Good primary metrics are:

- [ ] Represents delivery of the real value - something that people wants; revenue is one case of the metric
- [ ] Captures recurring value - MRR in SaaS tools, DAU in news / content related startup, etc
- [ ] Lagging indicator for success - e-mail signups is a bad example (you don't know if he/she will use the product), best indication is when the value was delivered
- [ ] Usable feedback mechanism - helps you prfioritize strategy; MAU is too long and you don't know what happen within the month

Two primary metrics to choose from (sometimes called North Star metric):

- [ ] Revenue - ideally choose that
- [ ] Active users

Hard earned dollars given to you, is the best test that people value your product.

Free users gives you a different feedback, than a paid users.

If your model is revenue based, you shall collect enought users first (like Google or Facebook), you can choose active users.
Or if you have a network effect, like a marketplace.

If you use active users as a primary metric - you shall make sure count them right. Not just the ones, who just signed up into the system.
How do you count if you have two type users (like Uber or AirBnB)? You better choose another metric - nights slept, trips.
Examples:

- [ ] AirBnB - bookings / stays, annual
- [ ] Facebook - active users, daily / monthly
- [ ] Ebay - gross merchandise value, daily / weekly
- [ ] Grin (S18) - rides / rides per user, daily / weekly
- [ ] Ubits (S18) - courses taken (vs dollar), monthly

Another case when no revenue, nor the active users - it's a biotech, when you try to understand if works at all.
if there is no regulatory issue, then it should be most probably revenue. Otherwise, your primary metric is to define technical milestones, that mitigate the risk, show how it works, etc.

Secondary metric helps to complete the picture - 3-5 metrics (close to 3) to pair with primary, to get a 360 overview. There are tons of them to choose from:

- [ ] Retention
- [ ] Revenue Churn
- [ ] CAC
- [ ] Payback period
- [ ] NPS
- [ ] Email conversion
- [ ] Organic vs paid users
- [ ] Referral rate
- [ ] Contribution margin
- [ ] Gross margin
- [ ] GMV
- [ ] ACV
- [ ] TCV
- [ ] Burn rate
- [ ] etc

What programmers think about the product 

Don't choose too many of them, otherwise you fall into analysis paralysis.

And what if you haven't launched yet - think about your metrics, and focus on launching.
This would help and motivate on checking the traction.

How do you set goals? 

[http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html)

Read the article above.

Build something many people want.

Reach and serve all those people.

Goal - is to set weekly % to grow (like 10%). Divide into doable chunks. 

Do things that don't scale, but will attract the users. Don't worry about eventual goal of 10'000.

Good statups, based on YC stats grows:

![](%23%23%20Startup%20School/Screenshot%202020-03-01%20at%2015.27.51.png)

[YC stats of good grow](https://www.notion.so/fbb77c0bd1264c2791ecb0af28c7bcc1)

So, 5 - 7% week-o-week is a good growth rate, 10% - is an exceptional growth rate.

If not - you can have a good small business. If you want to have a good growing business, you need to match the goals above.

If you are solving  real problem in a large market, that means there is a ton of waiting demand there, people will use just anything, to use your product, even if it's half broken, half baked, or just solve the bit of the problem.

Which means that usually startups usually have fast initial growth, which can stale at some point of time.

Time to sale is important.

Focus on organic vs paid traffic (paid users are cheating on the growth).

Goal is to have an exponential growth.

Goal should be a little hard to achieve.

Tracking progress - motivational tool, tracking how you achieve the goal & KPI. And put it everywhere!

It's ok not to reach the goal one or a few weeks in a row, if you understand why.
If you don't know why, go and speak with the users.
If you are not hitting your weekly goal, that means you are moving into a wrong direction.

LTV could be ignored at the beginning of the startup (when you don't have a data at all, or just a few months). Payback period could be a better metric (ideally it should be zero).

If you need funding on MVP - is it too ambitious?
Pre-sales are the best option; investors wants situation to be derisked as possible.


## Analytics for Startups

by Ilya Volodarsky
Why focus on analytics on every step?
1. Test product market fit
2. Focus the team.
3. Operate & grow the company.
Funnel for the service (like Netflix):
Acquire [sign up]: how many signups this week vs last?
Engage (→ Retain) [video played]: how many users are re-engaged week over the week?
Monetize [subscription done]: how much revenue week over the week?

 [Nine business models and the metrics investors want](https://www.notion.so/Nine-business-models-and-the-metrics-investors-want-c3085b30320a4341a395c00829aa04ec) 


## Nine business models and the metrics investors want

By Anu Nariharan
Metrics - how do you plan to charge your users? Which is based on your business models:
* Enterprise (Docker, Cloudera, FireEye) - contracts and they ket metrics are:
	* Bookings - sum of value of all customers contracts (not a letters of intent, neither a verbal agreements)
	* Total customers - unique contracted customers today
	* Revenue - billed or ratable and delivered service, over the life of the agreement
* SAAS (Segment, Ironclad, Sendbird):
	* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) - revenue recognized for recurring services rendered in a given month (doesn’t include one-time and non-recurring revenue, such as fees & professional services revenue)
	* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) = MRR * 12 (but, it’s important that it’s recurring!! which means you don't invest into getting same user every time)
	* GROSS MRR CHURN - monthly recurring revenue lost in a given month / monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the month.
	* PAID CAC - not adviced at the beggining (organical growth is prefererable) - cost per customer acquired via paid marketing channels (sales and marketing)
* Usage-based

* Subscription - sells a product or service, usually - to a consumer, on a recurring basis (The Athletic, Dollar Shave Club, Blue Apron) - very similar to SaaS, but a bit different, but - measure your monthly grow and unit churn, not dollar churn. Because, if you selling to companies, every company brings quite a huge impact on your revenue.
	* MRR (same as SaaS)
	* MRR CMGR (Compound Monthly Growth Rate) - implied compounded monthly MRR growth rate between two disparate months; CMGR = (lowest month MRR / first month MRR) ^ (1 / # months) -1]
	* Gross User Churn - total lost customers (cancelled subscriptions) in a given period / prior period total customers.
	* PAID CAC (same as SaaS)
* Transactional (ex. Stripe, PayPal, Coinbase, Brex) - company enables a financial transaction on behalf of a customer and collects a fee (usually - a percent of the underlying transaction)
	* Gross Transaction Volume (GTV) - total sales or payment dollar volume transacted in a given period
	* Net Revenue - the portion of GTV that the company recongizes as revenue for services rendered.
	* User Retention - Percent of customers who go on to make at least one purchase in month 2 (this is a cohort metric); unless the customer is out of business, it should keep using you (if not - why?)
	* PAID CAC (same as SaaS)
* Marketplace (ex. AirBnB, eBay) - looks like transactional, but it’s not - it’s typically for the consumers; and you typically have two sides. It’s a company that acts as an intermediary in the sale of a good or service between sellers and buyers, generally collecting a percent of the total transactional value.
	* Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) - total sales dollar volume of merchandise transacted in a given period
	* Net Revenue (same as Transactional)
	* Net Revenue CMGR (same as subscription)
	* User retention (same) - example of AirBnB - people’s usually travel once per year, so they to consider that.
	* Paid CAC (same) - be sure to include all costs associated with with user acquisition, such as referral incentives, discounts, credits, etc. (AirBnB example - they paid to acquire hosts)
* E-commerce - company, that sells physical goods online. Generally, e-commerce companies manufacture and inventory those goods (ex: Warby Parker, Bonobos, Memebox)
	* Monthly revenue - total revenue in a given month
	* Revenue CMGR (same)
	* Gross Margin - gross profit in a given month / total revenue in the same month (gross profit equals total revenue less cost of sales and goods sold) - important to count that from the day-1. It’s a mistake - not breaking down all costs included and those excluded in gross profit calculations.
	* Paid CAC (same)
* Advertising (ex. Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit) - offers a free service to consumers and derives revenue entirely, or predominatory, from advertisers. Common advertising companies include social networks and content sites. This business is all about users. So:
	* Daily Active Users (DAU) - total number of unique users active in a 24-hour day, averaged over a given period of time.
	* Monthly Active Users (MAU) - total number of unique users active at least once in last 28 days.
	* Percent Logged-in - total monthly users with a registered account (“logged-in”) divided by the total unique visitors (inclusive of both “logged-in” and “logged-out”) during the same 28-day window.
* It’s important to define what is “active”.

* Hardware - sells physical devices to consumers or businesses (ex. Fitbit, GoPro, Xiaomi). Metrics are quite the same as an e-commerce.

* If you don’t fit into those models, that’s something very complicated - a moonshot.

When measuring & presenting the data, show % as well as absolute data.
In front of the investors - focus on users and how do you monetize.
You usually start with pilot / small teams, before going big.
Good CAC is zero, especially at the beginning. As you scale, things could change.
