Knowledge database - dump of the things I worked through.

- Excerpts folder containing an excerpts from the articles and - mostly - books
- Recipes - technical / software engineering ready to use recipes, how-to-s

This KDB is managed locally from Obsidian that is pushed to GitHub and converted to a static site using mkdocs.

I tend to rework and clean up things, but no commitments.
