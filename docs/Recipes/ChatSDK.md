# ChatSDK (draft)

> With Android itâ€™s very easy, you just checkout the project and compile the XMPP target  
> With iOS, the libraries are split across different repos. You would need to check out:
> 1.  Chat SDK iOS project from standard Github repo
> 2.  XMPP repo
> 3.  Modules repo.
> Then download this project (XcodeXMPPSwift.zip) and update the podfile so the paths match the repo locations.
