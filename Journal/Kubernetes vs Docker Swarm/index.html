<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br />
If you need nodes auto-scaling - adding and removing servers on a high scale depending on the load proceessed by the application, managed Kubernetes from a cloud provider of your choice is the way to go.In all other cases, Docker Swarm is just enough.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes pro's</strong><br />
- servers auto-scaling with the load (adding and removing servers as the traffic or calculations grow or decrease);<br />
- flexibility to build programmed environments that serves very complex and huge scenarios, without manual intervention, if done right.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes cons</strong><br />
- it's a complex and expensive thing, separate domain expertise - prepare for a steep learning curve or a significant paycheck for the DevOps / SRE services;<br />
- Kubernetes version update is a manual procedure, could cause service interruption and shall happen every year at least: API is only stable between the patch versions ('z' in x.y.z version name), a release is supported for a year and some apps have direct requirements for a specific Kubernetes version;<br />
- as Kubernetes was designed to be stateless, hosting stateful applications (all sort of databases) is a risk - so much could go wrong here, so if you have to use it that way, make sure you invest into choosing a proper architecture, regular and reliable backup &amp; functional testing.</p>
<p><strong>Swarm pro's</strong><br />
- ease of setup and configuration, especially with tools like CapRover<br />
- easy (automatic) updates<br />
- capable of executing single or multiple app(s) on a single or multiple server(s) - for load spikes and/or fail tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>Swarm con's</strong><br />
- complex cluster configuration is a hassle...<br />
- ...and servers auto-scaling is the biggest one.</p>
<p>It's not impossible, though you can create your own scripts with the tools like cadvisor, which will call cloud provider API, Terraforming new servers, or calling your scripts via cloud-init, but... so many could go wrong here...</p>
<p><strong>What if it has to be Kubernetes?</strong></p>
<p>If you still got to use it, here are some of my findings that could be of help:<br />
- I found Lens Kubernetes IDE as of great use - it runs as an app from your computer (MacOS, Linux &amp; Windows) - no need to open extra port/service at production + it helps to navigate and troubleshoot the cluster; k9s is a bit less functional but a very nice option for the command line;<br />
- Do GitOps. Don't do direct 'root' (default kubeconfig) access, especially if you manage the cluster across the team - let Git be the only source of truth - a golden rule of thumb for any complex system anyway;<br />
- Use Terraform to describe your cluster.If you have a significant dynamic part created at run-time, having a dedicated logging mechanism - that stores all YML commands for an easy issues investigation and roll-back is another great thing to do.<br />
- Hypothesis - not yet battle-tested: microk8s and Rancher could be of use in some cases, as they both provide a fixed, most commonly required set of features and are relatively easy to maintain.Rancher even has Hetzner drivers (and an unofficial configuration guide), which means it brings auto-scale cluster at the cost of relatively cheap quite reliable physical machines.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong><br />
- CapRover - https://caprover.com - a very nice and handy single or multi-server cluster formation and management tool.Quick start I used to use is https://github.com/alexander-potemkin/quickies<br />
- Lens (The Kubernetes IDE) - https://k8slens.dev<br />
- k9s - https://k9scli.io - a command-line tool to check and manage your cluster.Quick start guide:  sudo snap install k9s (Linux) / brew install k9s (MacOS) followed by k9s --kubeconfig=$your-kubeconfig -n all<br />
- Microk8s - https://microk8s.io/docs<br />
- Rancher - https://rancher.com/docs/</p>
